        "title": "Court Puts On Hold Lindsey Graham's Testimony In Georgia Election Probe",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal appeals court on Sunday agreed to temporarily put on hold a lower court’s order requiring that U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham testify before a special grand jury that’s investigating possible illegal efforts to overturn then-President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.A subpoena had instructed the South Carolina Republican to appear before the special grand jury on Tuesday.U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May last Monday denied Graham’s request to quash his subpoena and on Friday rejected his effort to put her decision on hold while he appealed. Graham’s lawyers then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.On Sunday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court issued the order temporarily pausing May’s order declining to quash the subpoena. The panel sent the case back to May to decide whether the subpoena should be partially quashed or modified because of protections granted to members of Congress by the U.S. Constitution.Once May decides that issue, the case will return to the 11th Circuit for further consideration, according to the appeals court order.Graham’s representatives did not immediately respond Sunday to messages seeking comment on the appellate ruling. A spokesperson for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis declined to comment.Willis opened the investigation early last year, prompted by a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. During that conversation, Trump suggested Raffensperger could “find” the votes needed to overturn his narrow loss in the state.Willis and her team have said they want to ask Graham about two phone calls they say he made to Raffensperger and his staff shortly after the 2020 general election. During those calls, Graham asked about “reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,” Willis wrote in a petition seeking to compel his testimony.Graham also “made reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign,” she wrote.Republican and Democratic state election officials across the country, courts and even Trump’s attorney general found there was no evidence of voter fraud sufficient to affect the outcome of the election.During a hearing earlier this month on Graham’s motion to quash his subpoena, Willis’ team said Graham may be able to provide insight into the extent of any coordinated efforts to influence the results of the 2020 general election in Georgia.The U.S. Constitution’s speech or debate clause protects members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts. The 11th Circuit court instructed May to determine whether Graham “is entitled to a partial quashal or modification of the subpoena” as a result.Graham’s attorneys have argued that the calls were made as part of his legislative duties and that provision gives him absolute protection from having to testify in this case.In her order last week, May noted that the clause doesn’t protect actions that are political rather than legislative. Even if she accepted that the calls were “comprised entirely of legislative factfinding,” and thus protected, “there would still be significant areas of potential testimony related to the grand jury’s investigation on which Senator Graham could be questioned that would in no way fall within the Clause’s protections,” she wrote.___Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",

        "title": "As Biden turns toward midterms, he may not be the top surrogate ",
        "content": "Joe Biden on Thursday will effectively launch his midterm campaign efforts, attempting to capitalize on one of the best stretches of his presidency and beginning the hard task of persuading voters to keep Democrats in control of the House and the Senate.But he has also been in an uncomfortable position, as an anchor for many in his party — and for Biden, who for decades has prided himself on being one of the most sought-after Democratic surrogates, it’s also an unfamiliar one.He’s being attacked more often in televised ads than Obama was at this point in 2010, or Trump was in 2018. He goes largely unnamed on Democratic campaign websites and Twitter accounts. And candidates in key races in battleground states are either not asking him to come — or actively avoiding him when he does, according to a Washington Post survey of more than 60 candidates in the most competitive gubernatorial, U.S. Senate and congressional campaigns in the country.Few candidates said they wanted Biden to campaign for them in their state or district, with many not responding to the question at all. The Post also asked if candidates wanted Vice President Harris as a surrogate campaigner for the Biden administration and got the same set of unenthusiastic responses.“No comment from the campaign at this time,” said a spokeswoman for Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), who is a Republican target in a state that Biden won by more than 13 points.“We have not asked President Biden or VP Harris to campaign in Ohio and have no plans to do so,” said a spokeswoman for Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who is the Democratic nominee in a tight U.S. Senate race. Pointing to a range of surrogates for Republican nominee J.D. Vance, the spokeswoman, Izzi Levy, added, “Tim has been very clear that he wants to be the face of this campaign, and that’s not changing anytime soon.”Several Democratic candidates didn’t say they were opposed to Biden appearing with them in their states. But they weren’t exactly warmly embracing the idea, either.“Well, I mean, I welcome anybody to come to Arizona and let me, you know, show them around the state and, you know, the issues that we’re facing,” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said when asked if he wanted Biden to campaign with him. “So, yeah, I mean, it doesn’t, doesn’t matter who it is.”Plans for a Biden road showWhite House officials are preparing to use the coming weeks to showcase some of Biden’s recent accomplishments, which include a sweeping law that lowers prescription drug prices, addresses climate change, and reduces the deficit.They point to a message that Biden took on special interests to solve problems that Democrats have sought to address for decades, and they have plans for Biden to travel the country to tout his victories, sell a Democratic agenda, and warn about what Republicans would do if voters give them control. They believe that Biden, who they view as the quarterback of the party’s policies and its political future, will be a sought-after commodity.“A lot of these things, Democrats have been trying to accomplish them for a long time,” said Cedric L. Richmond, a senior official at the Democratic National Committee and former senior White House adviser. “Who wouldn’t want the person who was finally able to do that to come and campaign for them?“If they are reluctant, I think it’s political malpractice,” he added. “If you don’t want Biden, it’s malpractice.”Richmond said he expects Biden to frequent the campaign trail, and he brushed aside any notion that candidates might want to distance themselves from the president.“If we had a dollar for every time someone underestimated or counted Joe Biden out, we could pay off the national debt,” he said. “You’ll see his numbers go up, you’ll see accomplishments happen. That’s what voters want to see — and if I’m a candidate, I’d tie myself to that.”A Biden adviser pointed to several appearances the president has made this year with candidates in competitive races, including Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio). Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.) was planning to appear with Biden on a Pennsylvania trip that was canceled because of Biden’s covid diagnosis.But if there is a widespread shift toward embracing Biden, a president with more swagger and more momentum than he had a few weeks ago, it isn’t noticeable yet.Campaigns hope that he sets the national tone, touting the accomplishments they are proud of and running on in their races, and that he provides fundraising help, according to interviews with aides in several campaigns. But with many owning approval ratings that far exceed Biden’s, candidates do not necessarily need Biden’s help.“If he wants to come to Wisconsin, please, come on down,” Mandela Barnes, the Democratic nominee in a close U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, said when asked recently if he wanted Biden to campaign with him. “We’re here to talk about a vision, rebuild the middle class, and if he wants to join us in carrying that vision across the state, he’s more than welcome to do so.”History isn’t on his sideBiden is also facing the head winds of history.Since 1934, the only first-term president whose party hasn’t lost House seats in a midterm election was George W. Bush, when Republicans gained eight seats in the 2002 midterms at a time when the country was on wartime footing in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Incumbent presidents are often seen as a political liability, and candidates come up with creative ways to avoid a potentially damaging photo with them.James Thurber, an author, historian, and professor who founded American University’s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies, said Biden faces a similar challenge to past presidents trying to persuade a skeptical electorate. But he also is in a position in which the country is far more polarized and Biden’s predecessor is so active in sowing doubt about him.“Biden has a lot of things going against him,” he said. “He’s down in the polls, he has inflation. He has a former president’s supporters criticizing him and saying he’s not a legitimate president. These are unique in our history, in my opinion. Therefore, his strategy has got to adapt to that. And I think they know he has to be very careful and strategic.”When Biden appears in Montgomery County, Maryland, on Thursday — his first political rally in months — he will be in friendly territory, and joined by the state’s marquee candidate.“I will be there, and I’m excited to welcome him,” said Wes Moore, the state’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee. “If you look at what has happened in the last few months — infrastructure and climate, giving veterans exposed to burn pits care — that relationship and that partnership is important to the state of Maryland.”Biden also is planning to travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Aug. 30 to talk about efforts to reduce gun violence. Some of the state’s top candidates — gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro and Senate candidate John Fetterman — have appeared with Biden previously, although it is unclear whether they will be there for the event.In some midterm cycles when congressional candidates try to keep their distance, an incumbent president may find solace in standing with governors in friendly states. But the response for Biden has been largely lukewarm.A spokeswoman for Ohio’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Nan Whaley said she “would welcome anyone who believes in her vision for Ohio” but said they hadn’t asked Biden or Harris to come. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-Mich.) recently held a virtual event with Biden around the Chips legislation — which is expected to provide a particular boon for Michigan — but it’s unclear if they would hold an in-person campaign event.“As she has said previously, Governor Whitmer will continue to work with anyone to get things done for Michiganders, including President Biden and his administration,” said Maeve Coyle, the communications director for Whitmer’s campaign.Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-N.Y.) was one of the few candidates who said flatly that she would want Biden or Harris to campaign with her. TV ads already targeting BidenMidterm elections are often a mandate on the president, and Biden over his decades in public life has helped make the mandate about others. This will be the first time that challenge will be on him. And while Biden built his political brand around being affable and working across the aisle, he has become an animating force for Republicans.One in five of all broadcast television ads include an attack on Biden, according to an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project of data from Kantar Media/CMAG. He has been targeted more often than Obama was at this point in his first term, but not as negatively as Obama was in the 2014 midterms during his second term.He has been attacked in greater frequency than even Trump was at this point in 2018, in part because Republicans have run more ads so far this year. But even now, Trump is mentioned almost as frequently as Biden, a rarity in politics as prior presidents tend to feature infrequently in midterm ads.Less than 3 percent of the ads mention Biden in a positive light, and usually only as a fleeting message.“From the few ads that mention Biden in a positive way, it’s not as if he’s featured in the ad themselves with the candidate walking down the White House lawn with the president,” said Michael Franz, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. “It’s pretty much the text itself, and in a litany of the other things the candidate is supporting. We treat that as a positive mention, but it’s not exactly an embrace of him or his leadership.”The infrequent positive mentions of Biden are in line with past midterms, when Obama also went largely unmentioned in Democratic ads in 2010 and 2014, according to the analysis. But Trump is often mentioned in a positive light by Republicans, partly due to primary ads where his endorsement has been viewed as an asset.“Trump is a weird, as always, outlier. In 2018, he was mentioned approvingly by plenty of Republicans in that cycle,” Franz said. “This time around Trump is also being mentioned positively even though he’s no longer president, which stands out, too.”But some Democrats in tight races are now actively running against Biden, and criticizing him in their ads.Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), who is running for reelection in a district that Trump carried in 2020, recently took out an ad in which he says, “I was the only Democrat to vote against trillions of dollars of President Biden’s agenda because I knew it would make inflation worse.”Kaptur, the Ohio congresswoman who has held her seat for nearly four decades and is the longest-serving woman in the House, is running a new ad in which she explicitly blames Biden for “letting Ohio solar manufacturers be undercut by China” and touts how she is working with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).“Marcy Kaptur: She doesn’t work for Joe Biden,” the ad says. “She works for you.”It’s possible that Biden will become more of a campaign trail draw in the coming weeks, and his advisers still hope he gets a bounce in polling after several weeks of positive news. They also hope that inflation numbers will hold steady or decrease, and that gas prices will continue to go down.A history of surrogate work for other DemsBiden has always prided himself on being one of the top draws for Democrats. In the 1970s, he was the young, rising star who became an early endorser of Jimmy Carter. In the 1980s, he was the accomplished senator and presidential candidate who spoke at Democratic dinners and enjoyed traveling the country.Biden in 2010 was a key surrogate for the Obama administration, with the then-vice president traveling to districts where Obama himself wasn’t desired. That often meant White, working-class areas, which became part of Biden’s political brand.In 2018, he was one of the most sought-after surrogates, traveling to suburban districts and Midwestern states where his brand as a moderate Democrat was viewed as a crucial asset.He did events in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida. He held rallies in Montana for Sen. Jon Tester (“If I’d walk out into a parking lot and seven guys jumped me, this S-O-B would jump in and help me.”) and in Indiana for Joe Donnelly (“If I were coming through my neighborhood and I got jumped by four guys … it wouldn’t make a difference, Joe would jump in and help me.”).A few weeks before the 2018 midterms, Biden came to Las Vegas to rally Nevada Democrats. Nearly every top Democrat in the state — Reps. Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, Gov. Steve Sisolak, and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto — appeared with him.Asked in recent days whether they would like Biden to come to the state this time, Horsford, who affirmed he would, was the only one to respond.Annie Linskey contributed to this report.",

Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) at a House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis hearing entitled ‘State Perspectives on Cutting Methane Pollution’ on Tuesday, June 14, 2022.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) on Sunday sought to distance himself from those in his party calling to defund the FBI following the agency’s search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n\n\n“Oh yes, it’s crazy,” Crenshaw responded when CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about recent GOP rhetoric on “State of the Union.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMany in the GOP have portrayed the search, which was connected to an investigation into the former president’s handling of classified documents, as politically motivated. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed impeachment articles against Attorney General Merrick Garland and called for the FBI to be defunded.\n\n\n\nThose demands have been met with condemnation from some in the GOP, drawing comparisons to the defund the police movement that has been promoted by progressive lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\n“It makes us seem like extremist Democrats, right?” Crenshaw said on Sunday. “And so Marjorie and AOC can go join the defund the law enforcement club if they want. Ninety-nine percent of Republicans are not on that train.”\n\n\n\nDespite separating himself from those calls, Crenshaw on Sunday did call for accountability and transparency from the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) following the search, saying it was “automatically political.” \n\n\n\nA federal judge last week signaled openness to releasing a redacted version of the affidavit to support the search warrant application, but the DOJ has opposed the move, citing concerns for witness safety.\n\n\n\n“The criticisms that we’re leveling against the FBI and DOJ are fully warranted,” Crenshaw told Tapper. “It is not those criticisms that lead to a crazy person attacking an FBI.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn armed man attempted to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office in the days following the Mar-a-Lago search, and the intelligence community cited the incident in a recent bulletin warning of increased threats to federal law enforcement.\n\n\n\nThe FBI arrested a Pennsylvania man following the search for allegedly threatening to kill the agency’s personnel.\n\n\n\n“That’s completely wrong, but that’s not where 99 percent of Republicans are at, of course,” Crenshaw said on CNN.\n",

        "title": "Defense in school shooter’s trial set to present its case",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz is escorted into the courtroom during the penalty phase of his trial at the Broward County Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2022. | Pool photo by Amy Beth Bennett\n\n\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — The prosecution spent three weeks telling jurors how Nikolas Cruz murdered 14 students and three staff members at a Florida high school four years ago. Now his attorneys will get their chance to present why they believe he did it, hoping to get him sentenced to life without parole instead of death.\nMelisa McNeill, Cruz’s lead public defender, is expected to give her opening statement Monday, having deferred its presentation from the start of the trial a month ago.\n\nShe and her team will then begin laying out their 23-year-old client’s life history: his birth mother’s abuse of alcohol and cocaine during her pregnancy, leading to possible fetal alcohol syndrome; his severe mental and emotional problems; his alleged sexual abuse by a “trusted peer;” the bullying he endured; and his adoptive father’s death when he was 5 and his adoptive mother’s four months before his Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\n\n                                        McNeill’s decision to delay her opening statement appeared part of a broader strategy to not deny or lessen anything prosecutors told jurors about Cruz’s massacre — he pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of first-degree murder. This trial is only to decide his sentence; the seven-man, five woman jury will consider whether the prosecution’s aggravating circumstances “outweigh” the defense’s mitigating factors.The defense is “going to say, ‘Look, you saw what happened — we are not going to argue that. It was horrible, that was awful, that was horrific, whatever adjectives you want to use,” said David S. Weinstein, a Miami defense attorney and former prosecutor. But then the defense will add: “He never had a chance and, because of that, his poor victims never had a chance.’”This is the deadliest U.S. mass shooting to ever reach trial. Nine other gunmen who killed at least 17 people died during or immediately after their shootings, either by suicide or police gunfire. The suspect in the 2019 slaying of 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, is awaiting trial.During the prosecution’s case, McNeill’s team never cross-examined any teacher or student who witnessed the slayings and only had brief, mild exchanges with a few other witnesses.They asked one teacher from a classroom where no one was shot about the lack of a security monitor in the three-story building where the slayings happened. When the gun store owner who sold Cruz the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle used in the killings testified, they asked what Florida’s minimum age was in 2017 to buy a rifle — 18 — and today — 21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither they nor the prosecutors then asked the store owner why the law was changed: Cruz was 19 when the shooting happened and the Republican-led Legislature raised the age limit as part of a larger package of gun laws enacted in response to the shootings.\nCruz’s youth will be part of his defense and while Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer has barred the defense from presenting testimony that directly casts blame on third parties like school administrators for not preventing the shooting, McNeill and her team will likely try to indirectly make such points.\nTo get Cruz a life sentence, the defense will only have to persuade one of the 12 jurors, but they will have to do it on all 17 counts, one for each victim. It is possible, for example, a reluctant juror might be pushed to vote for death on victims who surveillance video showed Cruz shot multiple times as they lay wounded and helpless.\nThe defense will be trying to overcome the horrendous evidence that was laid out by the prosecution, capped by the jurors’ Aug. 4 visit to the fenced-off building that Cruz stalked for seven minutes, firing about 150 shots down halls and into classrooms. The jurors saw dried blood on floors and walls, bullet holes in doors and windows and remnants of Valentine’s Day balloons, flowers and cards.\nProsecutors also presented graphic surveillance videos of the massacre; gruesome crime scene and autopsy photos from its aftermath; emotional testimony from teachers and students who witnessed others die; and four days of tearful and angry statements from parents, spouses and other family members about the victims and how their loved one’s death affected their lives. Jurors also watched video of Cruz calmly ordering a cherry and blue raspberry Icee minutes after the shooting and, nine months later, attacking a jail guard.\nIt is unknown how long the defense presentation will take, but they said in court recently that it will last past Labor Day in two weeks. The prosecution will then get to present a rebuttal case before it goes to the jury. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The data does not list the child's gender, city of residence nor how the minor became infected.New York Department of Health spokesperson Monica Pomeroy said she was not able to disclose the minor's age.\"In instances where the number of cases is small, patient confidentiality prohibits the Department from disclosing this information,\" Pomeroy said.Previously, at least two other children in the US have had cases of monkeypox, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.One case involved a California toddler, and the other involved an infant who is not a US resident.The two cases are unrelated and probably the result of household transmission, the CDC said. Public health officials are investigating how the children got infected.Since the monkeypox outbreak began in May, most cases have occurred among men who have sex with men. But anyone can catch the virus through close skin-to-skin contact.In the case of children, the CDC said, this could include \"holding, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups, and utensils.\"The CDC said the Jynneos vaccine is being made available for children through special expanded use protocols.The agency has also developed new guidance for health care providers about identifying, treating and preventing monkeypox in children and teens.CNN Health's Brenda Goodman and Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.

It has been held by Russian forces since March.Nikopol was shelled on five different occasions overnight, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram. He said 25 artillery shells hit the city, causing a fire at an industrial premises and cutting power to 3,000 residents.The fighting in the proximity of Zaporizhzhia and Saturday's missile strike on the southern Ukrainian town of Voznesensk, not far from Ukraine's second-largest atomic plant, has spurred fears of a nuclear accident.On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held a phone call stressing the importance of ensuring the safety of nuclear installations, while underlining their \"steadfast commitment\" to Ukraine.  read more CRUISE MISSILE STRIKESLocal authorities also reported overnight missile attacks in the Odesa region, home to ports critical to a U.N.-brokered plan to help Ukrainian agricultural exports, key to global food supplies, reach world markets again.  read more Five Russian Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from the Black Sea at the region overnight, the regional administration spokesperson said, citing information from the southern military command. Two were shot down by Ukrainian air defences and three hit agricultural targets, but there were no casualties.Russia said on Sunday the missiles had destroyed an ammunition depot containing missiles for U.S.-made HIMARS rockets, while Kyiv said a granary had been hit.There were no fresh reports of incidents in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, after a series of explosions made headlines in recent weeks.In his speech, Zelenskiy referred obliquely to the blasts, for which Ukraine has not claimed responsibility, but analysts have said at least some have been made possible by new equipment used by its forces.\"You can literally feel Crimea in the air this year, that the occupation there is only temporary and that Ukraine is coming back,\" Zelenskiy said.In the latest incident, a drone attack on the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet was thwarted on Saturday morning, according to a Telegram post by Mikhail Razvozhayev, Crimea's Russian-appointed governor, who is not recognised by the West.In a daily Facebook update, Ukraine's general staff also reported several attempted Russian assaults over the past 24 hours in Donbas, the eastern region partially controlled by pro-Moscow separatists and a Russian target in the past months.In the south, Russian forces conducted a successful assault on the village of Blahodatne on the border between the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, it said. The city of Mykolaiv was hit with multiple S-300 missiles early on Sunday, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram.Russia's defence ministry said its forces had destroyed two M777 Howitzers in combat positions in the Kherson region, and a fuel depot in the Zaporizhzhia region.Reuters was not able to independently verify the battlefield reports.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comReporting by Ron Popeski and Natalia Zinets; Writing by Tomasz Janowski and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Nick Macfie, Gareth Jones and Daniel WallisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "date": 1661114323195,
        "title": "Daughter of Putin ally Alexander Dugin killed by car bomb in Moscow",
        "content": "The daughter of an ultranationalist Russian ideologue and ally of Vladimir Putin has been killed in a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow.Darya Dugina, whose father is the Russian political commentator Alexander Dugin, died when the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving was ripped apart by a powerful explosion about 12 miles (20km) west of the capital near the village of Bolshiye Vyazemy at about 9.30pm local time (1930 BST), according to investigators.Prominent Russian hawks without evidence quickly blamed Kyiv for the attack, calling it an assassination attempt and demanding the Kremlin respond by targeting government officials in Kyiv. “Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!” wrote Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-funded RT television station, reposting a call to bomb the headquarters of the Ukrainian SBU intelligence agency.If the car bombing is tied to the war it would mark the first time since February that the violence unleashed on Ukraine has reached the Russian capital, touching the family of a Kremlin ally near one of Moscow’s most exclusive districts.Kyiv strongly denied the allegations. “Ukraine has absolutely nothing to do with this, because we are not a criminal state like Russia, or a terrorist one at that,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in remarks broadcast on television.The blast occurred shortly after Dugina left the “Tradition” cultural festival at an estate where her father had given a lecture. The two were expected to leave together but instead got in different cars, a friend said.Five minutes later, a bomb exploded in the car Dugina was driving, killing her immediately.Witnesses said debris was thrown all over the road as the car was engulfed in flames before crashing into a fence.Investigators believed the bombing was “premeditated and of a contract nature,” said Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the investigative committee, the main federal investigating authority in Russia.Investigators work at the site of the suspected car bomb attack that killed Darya Dugina on the outskirts of Moscow. Photograph: Investigative committee Of Russia/ReutersAndrey Krasnov, a friend of Dugina and the head of the Russian Horizon social movement, confirmed the reports, according to the news agency Tass.He said the bomb could have been intended for her father.“This was the father’s vehicle. Darya was driving another car but she took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, he was at the site of the tragedy. As far as I understand, Alexander or probably they together were the target,” Krasnov said.However, the independent Russian news agency Agentstvo reported that leaked government databases showed the car was registered to Darya and not her father.Footage on social media appeared to show him at the scene in a state of distress.The head of the self-proclaimed, Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, wrote on his Telegram channel that Dugina had been killed and blamed the Ukrainian government.“Vile villains! The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin, blew up his daughter … In a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl!”Investigators said they had opened a murder case and would be carrying out forensic examinations to try to determine what happened. They said they were considering “all versions” when it came to working out who was responsible.Alexander Dugin. Photograph: Francesca Ebel/APDugin is known for developing an extreme rightwing view of Russia’s place in the world. He has been described as a “Russian fascist” and is a well-known conspiracy theorist.Some claim he helped shape the Russian president’s expansionist foreign policy. But the influence of Dugin over Putin remains a subject for speculation, with many insiders saying his sway on the Kremlin was minimal.The Kremlin through state media nonetheless found uses for Dugin, sometimes adopting his aggressive ideology, while at other times using him to discredit calls for a more aggressive nationalism in politics.Undeniably, however, his worldview of a clash of civilisations and his rejection of Ukrainian statehood appear to have gone mainstream in Russia, even if Dugin is still viewed as a man on the distant fringes of power.Dugin and his daughter had been sanctioned by the UK and US for acting to destabilise Ukraine. In its filing, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation called Dugina a “frequent and high-profile contributor of disinformation in relation to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on various online platforms”.The US Treasury sanctioned her as the chief editor for the website United World International, which it claimed was owned by the Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin.",

        "date": 1661114327850,
        "title": "End Times in Aspen",
        "content": "Here in Aspen, the air is thin, the snow is perfect, and money is everywhere. This is a singular American town in many respects. Among them is this: Aspen had, until very recently, two legitimate daily newspapers, The Aspen Times and the Aspen Daily News. At a moment when local newspapers face manifold threats to their existence and more and more American cities become news deserts, Aspen was the opposite: a news geyser. The town’s corps of reporters covers small-town tropes like high-school musicals and the Fourth of July parade. But Aspen’s journalists are also the watchdogs and chroniclers of one of the richest towns in America and a site of extreme economic inequality, the exemplar of the phenomenon that academics call “super-gentrification,” where—as the locals often say—“the billionaires are forcing out the millionaires.”I joined The Aspen Times as an editor in 2014, after a seven-year tenure at the Aspen Daily News. The Times has published since 1881, when Aspen was a silver-mining boomtown, through its postwar rebirth as a ski resort, and now as the home of ideas festivals, wine festivals, $50 entrees, and an awe-inspiring collection of private jets, many owned by billionaires deeply concerned about climate change. The paper, which was based for much of its history in a purple-painted building between a drugstore and the Hotel Jerome, developed a reputation for shoe-leather reporting and accountability journalism.On Thanksgiving 2021, the start of ski season, the Times editorial team numbered 13, including four reporters who had been covering our town since at least the 1990s. We were treated well by our parent company, Swift Communications. Our paper was profitable, owing largely to real-estate advertising. We seemed to be a safe harbor for small-town journalists.We were wrong.My story is populated by blue bloods and thin-skinned billionaires, including the owners of the Pittsburgh Pirates, a litigious Soviet-born developer, and the wealthy cousin of a U.S. Supreme Court justice. Its drama unfolds in a superficially idyllic mountain community where a 1969 mayoral candidate’s slogan, “Sell Aspen or Save It,” still sums up its core conflict. (The following year, Hunter S. Thompson mounted his “Freak Power” campaign for sheriff; upon losing, he gave a concession speech at the Hotel Jerome in a Founding Father–style wig. “I proved what I set out to prove,” he said, “that the American Dream really is fucked.”)Aspen is strange, but this is a story that could actually take place anywhere. It’s about what happens to the public interest when billionaires collide, and when newsrooms are bullied into suppressing coverage by people with great mountains of money and battalions of lawyers. And it speaks to a deepening crisis for the free press, which has been comprehensively betrayed in Aspen.I first saw Bob Nutting’s grinning face in a Zoom square on the morning of Tuesday, November 30, 2021, when I was summoned to a surprise all-company meeting for Swift, which operated The Aspen Times and its sister papers across ski country. I was there because Nutting’s company, Ogden Newspapers, had just bought us.Recommended ReadingThe West Virginia company traced its origins to H. C. Ogden’s founding of The Wheeling News in 1890 and now included 54 daily papers from Hawaii to North Dakota to New Hampshire. It was a fifth-generation family-owned-and-operated company, as Nutting told us, and as just about everybody from Ogden repeated at every opportunity after the announcement. These days, it is run by Bob Nutting and his brother, Bill, as CEO and vice president, respectively, with their father—the elderly and little-seen patriarch G. Ogden Nutting—still titled publisher, and Bob’s 33-year-old daughter, Cameron Nutting Williams, ascendant as chief revenue officer. It is Williams who is behind the company’s acquisition strategy.As Nutting spoke, I Googled his company. I learned that Nutting and his family also own the Pittsburgh Pirates, whose fans have nicknamed him “Bottom-Line Bob” for his habit of cutting loose the best ballplayers as soon as they got too expensive. But at least they aren’t a hedge fund, I thought. At least they aren’t Alden Global Capital, the vulture fund currently strip-mining so many American newspapers.We didn’t have to wait long for the first sign of trouble. It came that very first day, when Ogden sent a press release about the change of ownership to David Krause, the editor, and instructed him to run it in the next day’s paper. This was an unusually heavy-handed step for management at a news organization: The staff had assumed we would report our own story, ask questions (like the sale price, which had not been disclosed), and apply the same standard of reporting we’d apply to any event. Instead, Ogden wrote its own story about acquiring the paper, and ran it with Krause’s byline on it. (Krause was unhappy about this, but felt that his hands were tied.)Read: A secretive hedge fund is gutting newspapersIn the days that followed, Ogden introduced our new leadership team. A corporate human-resources director, who had come to journalism after a career in coal mining, read us the employee handbook over Zoom. Allison Pattillo, a local I had hired in 2019 to serve as a contract editor on our seasonal tourist-focused magazines, and who had started full-time in the summer of 2021, would be our new publisher. She would report to Scott Stanford, who had been a newspaper president in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and whom Ogden had named to oversee its Colorado papers. Stanford had no answers when employees asked about basics like health insurance and what was going to happen to the corporate apartments Swift had rented to reporters at a heavy discount to keep them living in an ever more expensive Aspen. Ogden had not bought those apartments from Swift, nor had it bought any of the buildings housing newsrooms. (Months later, Ogden offered a salary adjustment to some employees who lost housing.) Stanford did tell us about how, when he worked at the Steamboat Pilot & Today, he had written a column about his experiences skiing that contained the line “powder sucks.” This anecdote did not endear him to our team.To have a job in local journalism, though, is to tolerate some measure of indignity and upheaval. How bad could it be? we asked ourselves and one another during lunch-hour ski laps and over after-work drinks. Very very bad, we learned, when Vladislav Doronin came to town.Before March 2022, if Aspen locals had noticed Vladislav Doronin at all, it was because he was just another of the wealthy men who come to town for a few weeks each winter to ski in designer clothes of questionable utilitarian value and create private-plane traffic jams at the airport. He was born in the U.S.S.R., amassed a fortune transforming Soviet industrial real estate into office space for Western companies like IBM and Philip Morris, expanded into developing international luxury resorts, and had also found time to date (and rather bitterly and publicly separate from) the supermodel Naomi Campbell. When visiting, he could often be spotted skiing the black-diamond steeps of Aspen Mountain.And on March 4, 2022, Doronin bought a piece of it: nearly one acre on the mountain’s underdeveloped west side, for $76 million. The seller was a business entity led by Jeff Gorsuch, a former U.S. ski team downhill racer, a proprietor of a small chain of high-end retail ski shops, and a cousin of Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch.The plot of land is one of the most sought-after patches of sloped dirt in ski country, the site of the 1950 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, which helped put Aspen on the map. In a town where the developable land is finite and the wealth is seemingly limitless, the sale was big news. Just eight months earlier, Gorsuch and his partners had bought the plot from the Aspen Skiing Company for just $10 million. How this piece of dirt came to be worth $66 million more than it had been less than a year before was puzzling, as was the fact that Gorsuch had already marked the plot for a controversial and hard-won development project: the 81-room Gorsuch Haus hotel, along with 320,000 square feet of bars, restaurants, and shops, plus time-shares and a high-speed gondola. Because the development had required rezoning and had used a taxpayer subsidy, approval had been put to a highly contentious public vote that Gorsuch Haus won by just 26 votes.Bob Nutting (left) and Vladislav Doronin (right) (Jared Wickerham / Getty; Eamonn McCormack / Getty)The relationship between Aspen’s masses and its elites has been complicated since lifts started rumbling up the mountain eight decades ago. The CEOs, the mysterious tycoons, and figures like the former Starwood homeowner Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan live—usually very part-time—in compounds that employ a whole valley of service workers, and their six-figure property-tax bills fund good schools, public amenities, and subsidized employee housing for those of us in Aspen’s middle-class underclass. But in recent years, long-established mom-and-pop businesses around Aspen’s pedestrian mall have closed to make room for more luxury retail shops—“purse museums,” as they are known. Where the dive bar Cooper Street Pier once beckoned ski bums for pitchers and pool, the Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli now sells cashmere suits and $15,000 parkas. During the pandemic’s urban exodus, private-home development and real-estate sales have been supercharged to levels unheard of even here in Aspen. Property sales topped $4.6 billion last year, and the average single-family-home price hit $11 million. Locals and elected officials try to beat back the pace of development, but Aspen’s big money tends to do what it wants.When Russia invaded Ukraine last winter and Russian oligarchs with real-estate holdings all over the world were sanctioned, Aspen (and its media) wondered how much of Aspen’s economy was tainted. Less than two weeks into the invasion, when Gorsuch flipped a piece of the town’s history to a Soviet-born billionaire, the town lit up. (Doronin has not been sanctioned and says he has no ties to Putin or Russia.) The Times had been covering the Gorsuch Haus plan for more than three years already, and we ran an editorial criticizing Gorsuch and his partners for trading on his family name and misleading voters. A city-council member speculated in our pages that the land had been “a nice safe place to park money.” Stickers were pasted around downtown with the word GORSUCKS emblazoned below a Soviet hammer and sickle. Shortly before midnight the day after the sale to Doronin, an Aspen-based affordable-housing developer named Peter Fornell took a can of red spray paint to the window of Gorsuch Ski Cafe and scrawled a most devastating slur: GO BACK TO VAIL.We at the Times jumped on all of this. It was the biggest story in town. Managing editor Rick Carroll began digging into Doronin’s Russian assets and his background as a developer, wading through public documents and questioning Doronin’s representatives. John Colson, a local newspaperman of more than four decades, opened his March 7 column by placing Aspen “among the growing number of worldwide high-end resort communities happily entertaining and enriching peripatetic Russian oligarchs, among its historic roster of immensely wealthy people who come here to play and get a little richer whenever the opportunity presents itself.” He then went on to refer to Doronin explicitly as an oligarch.And then the pressure campaign began. Doronin’s PR reps soon contacted Krause, the Times’ editor, arguing that Colson’s use of the word oligarch and his implication about ties to Putin were defamatory. Though oligarch is not on its face a libelous term, Krause agreed to amend the article to read Russian billionaire instead of Russian oligarch and added an editor’s note saying, “Mr. Doronin’s spokesperson reached out Tuesday morning to The Aspen Times to threaten a lawsuit about the use of the term ‘oligarch’ — which the Times has amended — and pointed out that Doronin has publicly denounced Putin’s invasion.”But letters to the editor kept pouring into the paper, and Carroll kept digging. The more we reported, the more the paper was inundated: a cascade of correction and retraction demands from Doronin’s people on nearly everything we published about him.On April 13, Doronin filed a defamation lawsuit against the Times. He was represented by attorneys from the firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, based in Los Angeles. “The Aspen Times has chosen to … sensationalize a false narrative that targets Mr. Doronin simply because he was born in what is today Russia in order to attack the development of a luxury resort in Aspen,” the 17-page court filing reads. The suit also took issue with a letter to the editor the Times published, claiming the letter falsely implied Doronin was using his Aspen investment to launder tainted money from Russia. The filing goes to great lengths to detail how Doronin “earned his wealth legitimately,” and argues a semantic fine point: “Oligarchs are not merely wealthy individuals of Russian origin; they are individuals who have amassed their wealth through the exploitation of Russian natural resources, corrupt direction of Russian state-owned enterprises, and close political affiliation with Vladimir Putin.” This description, the suit argues, does not fit Doronin.Through a representative, Doronin said later that “his intention with the lawsuit was to address factual inaccuracies and false and defamatory statements that were having a negative impact, not to suppress ongoing coverage.\"But the newsroom worried this was an attempt to censor our journalism. We assumed the company would support its journalists, that we’d report a story about the lawsuit that day, and that we’d get back to work. Instead, Ogden officials ordered us to cease writing about anything remotely related to the lawsuit. Ogden was beginning settlement discussions with Doronin and, it said, any coverage of him, his suit, or Gorsuch Haus would disrupt those.In the eight weeks that followed, The Times published nothing—no letters, columns, or news stories—about Doronin or the development. Not only did we stop calling him an oligarch; we stopped naming him at all. In the newsroom, we wondered how Ogden had so quickly and thoroughly abandoned the bedrock principle of editorial independence to let powerful forces dictate the terms of our reporting.Krause was under orders to send any item mentioning Doronin up the chain to Stanford, the group publisher, in Gypsum, Colorado, and ultimately to Ogden headquarters in West Virginia for approval, which never came. Carroll had been putting together reporting based on court documents that showed that Doronin had transferred his one-third ownership of the Moscow-based Capital Group Development to his mother one day after filing the defamation lawsuit, despite claiming that he had long ceased conducting business in Russia. Carroll was instructed to not pursue the story further. The billionaires who ran our paper had capitulated to the billionaires who ran our town, and we couldn’t do anything about it.During the last week of April, Krause asked me into his office. He told me he was resigning and encouraged me to apply for his job. Pattillo, the publisher, also urged me on. Bill Nutting soon made it known I was also his choice to be editor, according to Pattillo. On a Zoom call with her, I raised my concern about the restrictions and said I couldn’t take the job without editorial independence. I was concerned that Doronin would drag out settlement talks for months, or that when one did arrive, Ogden would allow for some kind of gag order on coverage. She said that a resolution should come quickly and that restrictions would be lifted after that.I didn’t know it at the time, but that day Ogden spiked a column about Doronin by Roger Marolt. A 19-year veteran columnist at the Times and a fifth-generation Aspenite from an old mining and skiing family, Marolt had opposed the 2019 Gorsuch Haus campaign, but the new column was relatively innocuous. In it, he called out Doronin—though not by name—for failing to seek locals’ support for his development. “They don’t care what we think,” Marolt wrote of Doronin and his associates. “Maybe they don’t realize real people live here who depend on [development] for more than a boost in the Forbes 500 ranking.”The day before the column was supposed to run—the day Pattillo assured me the restrictions would soon be lifted—Krause emailed Marolt telling him that even an oblique reference was too hot for Ogden. “Our lawyers are currently in negotiations with their people on a settlement,” Krause wrote. “This is all complete BS and bullying (my opinion).” The next day, he announced his departure to the staff.The following Thursday, Ogden spiked a second Marolt column. The topic of this column was the spiking of his previous column. “Last week made me wonder if the foundation the hometown paper has stood solidly on for hundreds of years in this nation is finally cracking,” Marolt wrote. “In Aspen, anyway, the town papers seem no match for the insulted billionaire who can outspend them a thousandfold … People who don’t even live here can control the content of our papers.”The next week, the people who now controlled the content of the Times traveled to Aspen for damage control and personnel management. Ogden’s brass had now been pursuing me for weeks to replace Krause, and now they were lobbying me in person; I had been told I was their only candidate. I also received a verbal offer for the open editor job at their paper in Park City, Utah, which came on the heels of a February conversation about becoming editor of the Summit Daily News. I hoped I could use the apparent trust the company had in me to get them to stop censoring our coverage. They reassured me that this was an unusual situation, that they would fight defamation and libel lawsuits, but that in this case they thought it could be resolved quickly in a settlement. The following day, when they gave me a formal offer, I told them I would wait to accept until the lawsuit settlement was done and restrictions were lifted.Krause’s last day as editor was Tuesday, May 17, a month after the suit was filed. His farewell column was subtle but pointed: “Any ownership change in any business is tough, but I’ve been through a few in my nearly 40 years as a newspaper journalist, and I’m not up for another one at this point in my career,” he wrote. “There have been some bumps along the way the past four months, enough so that I am ready to take a different path.”Carroll, who had been openly talking about quitting and taking his Doronin reporting elsewhere, stepped in as interim editor. And Ogden kept the pressure on me to sign. Cameron Nutting Williams was the next company representative to talk to me about taking the job. She complimented the epic messiness of my desk, and suggested that she’d actually flown commercial to Aspen. Then she asked me about Doronin. “How hot is this story?” she asked. I told her there was no bigger story in Aspen right now. “We could be writing a story every day and running columns every day about this and it would not be enough.” Of course, we weren’t even doing that.Meanwhile, the Streisand effect was taking hold: Doronin’s apparent effort to muzzle the story was only drawing more attention to it. On May 20, The Denver Post ran a story on Doronin suing the Times for calling him an oligarch, one of several stories that would carry the magnate’s name and oligarch together and link them in Google searches for all time. A few days later, at a city-council meeting, Aspen’s mayor made a vague but provocative public comment about the situation: “It’s come to my attention recently that The Aspen Times, under duress, has been withholding and suppressing some news stories that are important to our community,” Torre, the one-named mayor, said. “I find that to be a real disservice to our community.”At 1:22 p.m. on May 25, Allison Pattillo wrote to the staff with what initially seemed like good news: The settlement was signed. In all likelihood, she said, the suit would be officially dismissed in about five days. The terms of the agreement would remain confidential. After the case was resolved, the Times deleted a letter to the editor calling Doronin “a big fish in Putin’s polluted sea” from the website, and removed references to him being an oligarch from various pieces. A Carroll piece originally headlined “Oligarch or Not, New Aspen Investor Has Russian Ties” was brightened to “New Aspen Investor Has Luxury Hotelier Connections.” On each of these stories, a penitent editor’s note was appended, suggesting that the piece as originally published did “not meet The Aspen Times’ standards for accuracy, fairness and objectivity in its news reporting.” Apparently all that this self-proclaimed non-oligarch billionaire and his bulldog lawyers wanted out of their lawsuit was to change some text on AspenTimes.com. We’d never seen anything like this at the Times. We ran corrections regularly when we made factual mistakes, of course. But revision-by-lawsuit is not in the Associated Press stylebook or taught in any journalism-ethics class.Pattillo had assured me there were no further restrictions on the Times covering Doronin. So I told the remaining eight people on the editorial team that I was going to accept the editorship and tried to lobby them out of quitting. I planned to let Roger Marolt tell his censorship story and run his spiked columns, bring in outside journalists to cover our internal tumult and the muzzling, be transparent with the public about this stain on the Times’ history, and then get back to covering Doronin.On June 3, Pattillo published a note that finally put the Times on the record about the lawsuit, the settlement, and the censorship, and assured readers that coverage restrictions had been lifted. The paper, she wrote, would now “continue with the journalistic integrity readers expect from the upstanding and award-winning editorial team at The Aspen Times.”The day after the Times published Pattillo’s note, Jeff Gorsuch’s lawyer sent a letter threatening a defamation lawsuit arising from the paper’s coverage. Reporters had worried aloud that capitulating to Doronin’s demands would invite more defamation suits from the rich and litigious, more attempts to chill critical coverage, more suppression from Ogden. Though we didn’t learn of Gorsuch’s threat right away, he quickly confirmed those fears. (In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for Gorsuch said, “There is a difference between suppressing accurate and balanced coverage and ensuring that libel does not occur.” The spokesperson also cited the fact that the paper had “quickly settled a libel claim brought against them” by Doronin and issued corrections and retractions as part of that legal agreement.)With the restrictions on Doronin coverage ostensibly lifted, however, I finally signed my offer letter on Wednesday, June 8. The day before, Pattillo had directed me to reach out to Roger Marolt about how to tell readers why his column had been missing for those two weeks; Roger sent a draft and we planned to publish it, along with the two spiked columns as well as email correspondence about Ogden’s censorship in an extended online version. Pattillo approved in principle, though she didn’t read the column before it was published. On Friday, June 10, it ran under the headline “An Old, Small Newspaper No Match for New, Big Money.”It was kicking up some conversations on the Times’ Facebook page that morning, but I hadn’t gotten any calls or emails about publishing it. Then, at 11, Pattillo came to my desk. “Scott Stanford is coming here,” she said. “And he is pissed.”Two hours later, I walked into the Times’ conference room, Aspen Mountain framed in the window before me. Stanford was already seated at the table, laptop open. It was clear, he said, that I didn’t trust my new bosses. And—after two days on a job they’d spent more than a month recruiting me for—they no longer trusted me. “We think you are working against us, not for us, and we are going to let you go.” He paused. “You will receive a FedEx package at your house tomorrow with your final check. Get your things and leave the premises immediately. We will contact you with instructions for how to clean out your desk area.” I would not be receiving severance.I had been fired before my title even changed on the masthead, for doing what I told my bosses I was going to do, after they had promised the restrictions had been lifted.The Marolt columns disappeared from the Times website on Saturday and took on a contraband cachet on social media. On Sunday, I met with the remaining editorial staff on Rick Carroll’s porch. Rick, who had broken the original news of the Doronin/Gorsuch deal and was now set to remain interim editor, told me he was the one who had hit “Delete” on the Marolt columns under Ogden’s orders. “I have blood on my hands,” he said with a tortured look on his face.The team talked about what to do next. They discussed organizing a walkout, publishing a coordinated social-media post, starting a new media organization, making a statement to the Daily News. In the end, they decided to give compromise one last shot. On Monday morning, in a meeting with Pattillo and Stanford, they asked for me to be reinstated. Stanford told them he would send the request up the flagpole, but the staff never got an answer.Meanwhile, word of my firing was spreading through town. The Daily News ran a story; for weeks, letters to the editor and columns about the situation would dominate its commentary pages. A paraglider–slash–limo driver wrote in calling for a boycott of the Times. One afternoon, a white guy with dreads to his waist was racking a mountain bike on his Jeep when he spotted me, raised a fist, and said, “First Amendment, bro. Thank you.”And at the June 14 Aspen city-council meeting, Councilman Ward Hauenstein called on the good rich people of Aspen to take their newspaper back. “Now it appears as though we have an out-of-state business that controls the Aspen press,” he said. “If something is wrong, you all must do something to stop it … We’re blessed to have many people living in Aspen with great means—I’m appealing to them now. Help save Aspen by funding the purchase of freedom and truth by buying the Times or funding a new paper where truth, integrity, and honor have a home.” (Thus far, none of Aspen’s many billionaires has heeded the call.)The day after Hauenstein’s cri de coeur, the Daily News ran a full story about it. The Times ran a short “staff report,” although it had a reporter in the room as always. She had turned in a full story about Hauenstein’s speech, but Pattillo and Stanford had edited it down to a few paragraphs.The Denver Post published a story about my firing on Saturday, June 18. (The Times’ production editor, the last person to touch the paper’s files before it goes to bed nightly, ran the story on Sunday and was prepared to get fired for it, appending an odd note at the end: “The decision to publish this Denver Post story was entirely at the discretion of production editor Benjamin Welch.” He wasn’t fired, but he later resigned.) The next week, 18 current and former Aspen-area elected officials wrote a letter to Bob Nutting denouncing Ogden’s muzzling of Doronin reporting, threatening to refuse interviews with the Times and calling for my reinstatement. Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, who has pushed legislation about frivolous journalism lawsuits, publicly denounced my firing.At the Aspen Ideas Festival, which annually draws media figures, world leaders, and CEOs to the Aspen Institute’s Bauhaus-designed campus, the financier turned anti-Putin activist Bill Browder mentioned the Doronin lawsuit and my firing in a public panel. “The guy was born in St. Petersburg, became a billionaire in Moscow real estate, and for calling him a Russian oligarch, he sues and somehow the journalists are losing their jobs?” Browder told the crowd assembled in the Hotel Jerome ballroom, next door to the building where Aspen Times reporters had, for decades, kept the powerful accountable. “That’s happening [here] right now, this minute, as we speak.”Less than nine months ago, on that Tuesday after Thanksgiving when we first virtually met Bob Nutting, the Times editorial team consisted of 13 people. The week of July 4, it was five, including just two full-time reporters. One resigned after 35 years. After yet another column was spiked, Marolt quit in protest and went to the Daily News. Local businesses have pulled their ads in protest, and Pitkin County commissioners have taken their legal notices to the Daily News. (Having a second paper as an option, commissioners recognized, was an extraordinary privilege.) Although the Times eventually republished the Marolt column from June—this time with none of the internal emails—it went nearly four months without running any new reporting on Doronin. Finally, on August 9, the paper ran a version of the Rick Carroll story they’d killed back in April. In it, Carroll quotes a joint statement by Ogden and Doronin’s representatives claiming that Doronin “does not exercise, or seek to exercise, any control over The Aspen Times’ current or future coverage of him.” (In a statement to The Atlantic, Ogden emphasized that it “continues to support The AT newsroom,” Doronin “has no say over the paper’s reporting,” and “our editorial independence has not been sacrificed.”)In Aspen, we have an engaged readership that made a lot of noise when the stewards of its journalism institution abnegated their responsibility, abandoning principles of press freedom in the name of business. We have other responsible news outlets that could cover what happened to me and to the Times. And by virtue of being Aspen, we have the eyes of the world on us.Read: The coronavirus is killing local newsBut most towns don’t have an Aspen Daily News or an Aspen Public Radio. They don’t have an alternative platform for the letter writers and the angry elected officials. They don’t have global power brokers breezing in for conferences. Ogden owns more than 50 daily newspapers across the U.S. If it is suppressing news stories in other cities and firing editors for attempting to be transparent with the public, nobody would know. If there is a version of Vladislav Doronin bullying Ogden in Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Sandusky, Ohio, or Lawrence, Kansas, what would stop them? Suppression of news creates disinformation, and Ogden is the gatekeeper for communities in 18 states. If it did it here, the company could do it anywhere. Maybe it already has.",

        "title": "Break the law or out a student? Florida teachers navigate 'Don't Say Gay' bill",
        "content": "Michael Woods, a special education teacher at a high school in Palm Beach County, Florida, said he used to have a classroom library with shelves of dozens of books that students could take home and read for fun. The library included the “Twilight” and “Harry Potter” series and a book called “Meg,” which is a thriller about a shark.But when school started this week, the classroom library was empty. The books now sit in a school closet, in part because of new laws that restrict classroom instruction. One of the measures, the Parental Rights in Education law — or what critics have called the “Don’t Say Gay” law — bans instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity “in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” Another new law restricts instruction about African American history.Michael Woods is a special education teacher in Palm Beach County, Fla. Courtesy Michael WoodsAs a result, Woods said, the School District of Palm Beach County sent out a checklist in May that teachers have to use to review all of the books in their classroom libraries.Woods said he doesn’t have time to go through every book with a checklist, so he decided to take them all down.“I didn’t have any controversial books, but what we keep hearing repeatedly is: ‘Well, if something happens, you could lose your license,’” he said, referring to a state educator’s license. “So they will remain in a closet, not helping anyone.”Proponents of the Parental Rights in Education law say it’s limited to classroom instruction in kindergarten through third grade, but critics say the part of the law that prohibits instruction that is “not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate” opens up teachers in any grade to lawsuits from parents.The law doesn’t give examples of what is age or developmentally appropriate, and it doesn’t outline what breaking the law would look like. As a result, school districts’ interpretations of how to best implement the law vary widely. In Palm Beach County, Woods said, teachers have received little guidance about how to abide by the law, and the guidance they have gotten has been unclear. For example, Woods said, teachers were told on the second day of school that they will have to fill out and send a form home to students’ parents if the students ask to use names that are different from their legal names. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the School District of Palm Beach County said the Florida Department of Education has provided information about the parental rights bill on a resource page.“The District is in compliance with the State’s Parental Rights measure,” the spokesperson said. “Information regarding a student’s preferred name is just one component of a form that parents are asked to complete. As part of the Parental Rights legislation, all parents and guardians must provide consent for health related services on our campuses. Every student, whether returning or new to the District, must submit a Student Registration Form.  In addition to health information, parents and guardians are asked to provide their current contact information, their child’s preferred name, and more.”Questions about the form have been met with “mixed answers,” Woods said. Teachers were told to use the form any time students ask to change their names, but teachers don’t have to use the form if students ask to use nicknames but don’t ask to change their pronouns, he said. Woods said they’re only a few days into the school year, but he’s already worried about the moment a student asks to use a different name but doesn’t want the form to be sent home.“I’m a queer man. I did not come out until I was 31 because of the fear,” he said. “Can you imagine how much angst or how much anxiety or how devastated I would be if I essentially outed a child? I’m essentially being asked by the state to out a child.”About 500 miles away, in the northern part of the state, Bay District Schools, based in Panama City, provided a thorough training video to employees, which Natalie Williams, a communications specialist for the district, said in an email is part of an eight-part annual update on state and federal laws.In the video, which Williams shared with NBC News, Heather Hudson, an attorney for the district, walks employees through situations that might raise questions under the Parental Rights in Education law. For example, if a middle school volleyball coach sees a female athlete walking down the hall holding hands with her girlfriend and the student says “Hey coach, have you met my new girlfriend?” and carries on walking down the hall, the coach doesn’t have to call the athlete’s parents to tell them their child is in a same-sex relationship, “just as I wouldn’t call to tell them that she was dating Billy or John,” Hudson said.If students disclose that they are struggling with their sexuality, Hudson said in the video, a teacher would have to inform parents only “if there is a change in the student’s services or monitoring related to the student’s mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being and the school’s ability to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for the student,” as the parental rights law states.  So if students tell school counselors that they want to use different pronouns or have access to different restrooms or locker rooms, Hudson said in the video, “then we’re getting into the territory of monitoring and services, and your school administrators need to be brought into the conversation, and we probably need to be having a conversation with the family.” Hudson said that staff members aren’t required to disclose information to parents if they have a “reasonable and fact-specific belief” that alerting parents would lead to abuse, abandonment or neglect but that the decision to withhold such information would have to be approved by a principal, documented in a student’s education records and reviewed annually. It’s unclear whether state education officials would agree with all of Hudson’s guidance, even though it cites the exact language of the law. At a state Board of Education meeting Wednesday, board member Ryan Petty took issue with a sentence in an LGBTQ resource guide for Hillsborough County Public Schools, which said, “With the limited exception involving the imminent fear of physical harm, it is never appropriate to divulge the sexual orientation of a student to a parent,” the News Service of Florida reported.As a result of Petty’s objection, Florida Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. directed his staff Wednesday to tell all school districts to pull LGBTQ support documents so the state Board of Education can review them, the News Service of Florida reported. Jon Harris Maurer, the public policy director for Equality Florida, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group, said removing LGBTQ resources, stickers and posters from Florida schools to comply with the parental rights law is “part of a bigger censorship agenda” coming from Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature that is affecting how LGBTQ youths can show up in schools.“Because this law is so vague, we’re seeing that it’s really playing out in the form of a lot of censorship and just silencing,” Maurer said. “Teachers and school districts don’t know where the lines are. So the law is having a real chilling effect where they’ll just pull back entirely.”DeSantis didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the new law or claims that it is part of a “censorship agenda.” When he signed the law on March 28, he said it would ensure “that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.” Some districts have already removed content from their websites and books from their libraries. In July, Duval County Public Schools removed a 12-minute anti-bullying video that taught middle and high school students how to support LGBTQ peers, Jacksonville Today reported. Some teachers were also directed to remove rainbow Safe Space stickers and posters that show LGBTQ allyship from their walls and doors before the first day of school Monday, The Florida Times-Union reported.  Duval County Public Schools didn’t reply to a request for comment. District spokesperson Tracy Pierce told The Times-Union that the district is “in the process of rebranding the ‘All in for Safe Schools’ program.”“The purpose of the rebranding is to send a clear message to all students that the support available through the program is open to them and not limited to any specific student population,” Pierce said.Several other districts made changes before the Parental Rights in Education law took effect July 1.In February, Collier County Public Schools, a district that includes part of Naples, began adding parental advisory notices to more than 100 books, many of which touch on issues related to race or the LGBTQ community. In July, Broward County Public Schools removed LGBTQ books from the shelves and sent boxes of them to the Stonewall National Museum and Archives in Fort Lauderdale, which is dedicated to preserving LGBTQ history, the Sun Sentinel newspaper reported. The district said the books were donated to free up office space before a district reorganization.“We know that these sorts of messages are telling LGBTQ youth that there’s something inherently wrong about LGBTQ people, and they’re telegraphing that these LGBTQ young folks should remain hidden,” Maurer said.Woods said the first week of school, which began Monday, has already been incredibly difficult. “I’ve been extremely overwhelmed as a gay man who now is openly out, because I have to be the advocate,” he said. “People know I’m a union leader, and they know that I’m a gay man. They’re coming to me for questions to be answered, like ‘What do we do?’ And it’s just frustrating for me, because I don’t have answers.”Follow NBC Out on Twitter, Facebook & Instagram.",

        "content": "MAKARIV, Ukraine — The Russian soldier taunted her: Your friend, he sneered, is lying on the floor, raped and naked and dead.S., a Ukrainian writer and government worker in her early 60s, froze at his words. Her neighbor Tetiana, a bold, dark-haired 37-year-old widow, had quickly attracted the attention of Russian soldiers who, within days of the Feb. 24 invasion, captured and occupied the small town of Makariv, about 30 miles west of the capital, Kyiv.“She would defy them,” said S., still shaken and sorrowful as she described the harrowing events of five months earlier, before late-winter chill gave way to spring, then high summer. “She would tell them: ‘I’m not afraid of you.’”                S. holds the door of her home, which was kicked in by Russian forces. (Kyrylo Svietashov / For The Times)   Weeks would pass before the outside world learned of the horrors that occurred in streets and basements and back gardens of these once-tranquil suburbs and satellite towns, which were occupied for roughly a month before Russian forces in early April broke off a failed bid to seize the capital.Townspeople who were unable or unwilling to flee endured the first wave of what Western governments and Ukrainian officials would later describe as a systematic campaign of atrocities by Russian forces against civilians: torture, execution-style killings, starvation.And rape.Little by little, month by month, investigators have laid the groundwork for what are now more than 25,000 active cases of suspected war crimes, covering a wide variety of offenses.Investigators compile narratives from witness testimony, from forensic examinations of mutilated corpses that are still regularly turning up — outside Kyiv, one body was recently found stuffed beneath a manhole cover — from intercepted communications by Russian soldiers describing their own acts, or from surveillance cameras that before the war monitored traffic and deterred shoplifters. As the war nears the six-month mark, however, cases involving sexual assault are proving particularly resistant to documentation.                A woman on a bicycle passes the home of S.'s slain neighbor in Makariv, Ukraine. (Kyrylo Svietashov / For The Times)   The prosecutor general’s office said  last week there are “several dozen” criminal proceedings underway involving sexual violence committed by Russian military personnel. But police, prosecutors and counselors say the true number is likely far larger, in part because of reluctance to report such attacks.“Sexual violence in this war is the most hidden crime,” Ukrainian civil-society activist Natalia Karbowska told the U.N. Security Council in June.A complex tangle of reasons underpins that silence. Some, like Tetiana, did not live to tell their stories. Some fled the country, joining an enormous exodus, and are not in contact with Ukrainian authorities. Others feel ashamed, clinging to the belief that they could somehow have prevented what befell them. Or a sexual attack might have taken place in the context of separate, overwhelming wartime loss: a home destroyed, a loved one killed.Still others look to the near-industrial-scale atrocities occurring elsewhere — daily bombardment of civilian areas; the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian POWs last month in what evidence suggests was a deliberate mass execution by Russian forces; reports of torture, detention and abductions in currently occupied areas – and convince themselves that they ought to quietly put their private agonies behind them.“They think others suffered more,” said Nadiia Volchenska, a 32-year-old Kyiv psychologist who co-founded a network that connects sexual assault victims with counselors. She said people who had been raped or sexually abused in the course of this conflict — most are women and girls, but many are men and boys — are often reluctant to speak even in confidence with a therapist, let alone go to police or other investigators and provide a detailed account.                A fence damaged by Russian forces sits in front of S.'s home in Makariv, which was under Russian occupation early in the war on Ukraine.(Kyrylo Svietashov / For The Times)   “Quite often, after making a first contact with us,” she said, “people will simply vanish.”::Rape as a weapon is as old as war itself. The objective, say those who deal with such cases, is to humiliate and degrade, to break the spirit of defenders, to shatter families and communities, to instill a sense of hopelessness and despair. It often leaves wreckage too profound to repair. “Of course it is not about sexual gratification,” said Natalya Zaretska, a military psychologist by training who is currently a volunteer in the Territorial Defense Forces, working with people in the formerly occupied territories in the Kyiv oblast, or province. “Rape is one instrument that is used to try to achieve this goal of subjugation.”Ukrainian officials believe a Russian campaign of terrorism against civilians was sanctioned at the highest levels, rather than the work of rogue troops. The Kremlin has derided well-documented atrocities in occupied areas as a fabrication, so for Ukraine, compiling proof and moving ahead with prosecutions is considered vital, even if such a reckoning takes many years. “Evil must be punished, or it will spread,” said Andriy Nebytov, the police chief for the Kyiv region.Authorities are circumspect about the specifics of sexual assault cases under investigation, but in a statement in response to written questions from the Los Angeles Times, the prosecutor general’s office cited a few representative examples.In the town of Chernihiv, north of the capital, a Russian unit commander used “physical and psychological violence” against a 16-year-old girl, threatening to kill family members if she resisted his sexual advances, or to hand her over to others to be gang-raped instead. In Brovary, east of Kyiv, a serviceman has been indicted in absentia for repeatedly raping the wife of a slain civilian. In another case in that same district, soldiers singled out one woman for assault, herding others into a locked basement. Another, Ukrainian officials say, was raped with her young child nearby.In carefully couched language, the prosecutor’s office cited obstacles faced by investigators, including the need to protect the privacy of minors and to avoid re-traumatizing survivors. But sheer stigma was described as the overriding factor.“Women who have been raped,” the statement said, “do not want to spread such information about themselves.”::Those who lived under Russian occupation earlier in the war describe a nauseating sense of constant fear.                A damaged home in Makariv, Ukraine. (Kyrylo Svietashov / For The Times)   S., who did not want even her full first name used because some of the troops who occupied Makariv back in March are still in Ukraine, is working with the authorities to try to identify those involved in Tetiana’s assault and death. Some of the occupiers addressed one another by names or nicknames, aiding in this process.On her smartphone, S. showed photos of individual soldiers sent to her by prosecutors, who for months have tracked the unit’s activities and obtained images of the suspects from social media and elsewhere. She recognized several, including ones who came regularly to her house and to Tetiana’s simple brick home next door to loot and carouse and threaten. She particularly feared one, a Chechen, whose erratic behavior made her think he was on drugs.When the Russians first arrived, S. was caring for her 90-year-old mother, who was in fragile health and adamantly refused to leave. But in the ensuing weeks, the soldiers’ violence and volatility persuaded her that they must seize any chance to escape.A neighbor man was shot by soldiers, eventually dying of his wounds, and S. was told his wife had been sexually assaulted. (That woman declined to speak with journalists about what had happened.) One day, a young soldier came to S.’s own house and tried to get her to go upstairs with him. Fearing he intended to rape her, she tried to dissuade him by noting the 30-year disparity in their ages.In the midst of this, other soldiers came to the house, telling the would-be assailant he was needed elsewhere, and he eventually left with them. S. felt a rush of terrified relief.On the day that she, her mother, Tetiana and a home health aide had been promised a ride to safety with a neighbor, her friend was nowhere to be found. Troops again burst into S.’s house, with one of them behaving bizarrely and demanding a bandage for an injury. After downing a shot of vodka, he blurted out news of her friend’s fate.                In Makariv, S. still thinks often of her neighbor Tetiana, of her humor, her quirks, her determination. S. looks out at the house her friend once lived in, trying to picture her vibrant and alive. (Kyrylo Svietashov / For The Times)   Soldiers refused to let her see Tetiana’s body, S. said. Eventually, a serviceman she believed to be an ethnic Buryat from Siberia offered to let her speak to someone he said knew the full story. That soldier told S. that Tetiana had been raped by several others, and that the Chechen was the one to stab and kill her. Ordered to bury the naked corpse, the soldier told S. they first wrapped the body in a blanket.“I felt shame that she is dead and I am still alive,” she said months later on a heat-heavy summer afternoon, brewing tea for visitors and keeping an eye on her mother dozing in an armchair nearby. “I have that guilt.”Rape counselors say that with many instances of assault having taken place early in the war, some of those people may be recovering their equilibrium enough to talk about what happened to them.“Sometimes we see this around six months later, the beginning of a willingness to open up,” said Volchenska, the Kyiv therapist. “But now we expect a wave of similar cases from Kherson” — a southern city seized by Russia early in the invasion, which Ukrainian forces hope to retake.“The problem is that you need to feel safe to talk,” she said. “And really nowhere in the country is safe.”In Makariv, S. still thinks often of Tetiana — her humor, her quirks, her determination. Every day, she looks out on the now-empty house her friend once lived in, trying to picture her vibrant and alive. She remembers Tetiana telling her about a dream she’d had, during the frightening days of occupation.“In it, she was on the cloud, flying,” S. said. “It was so peaceful. It was so good.”",

On Sunday morning she told ABC News she intends to focus on keeping election deniers out of office and said Mr Trump would be afraid to debate her in a 2024 match-up.Relatedly, Ms Cheney has said that panel members are “in discussions” with counsel for Mike Pence about testifying as part of the investigation into the Capitol riot. Asked about the FBI search and if he had taken any classified documents when leaving office, the former vice president told the AP he had not.This coming week will see a decision by Judge Bruce Reinhart as to whether the affidavit that led to the search warrant can be released in redacted form as media organisations have requested.

        "content": "\n\n\nVideoVideo Player is loading.Current Time 0:00Duration 0:00Remaining Time 0:00Who Is J.D. Vance, U.S. Senate Candidate Endorsed By Trump?     A warning shot has been fired to MAGA Republicans as a 2020 election result denier trails his Democrat opponent by 15 points in the race to become Pennsylvania's next Governor.An August 17 poll carried out by Public Opinion Strategies (POS) for Pittsburgh Works Together found Democrat Josh Shapiro has a commanding 35 to 50 percent lead over Trump-endorsed candidate Doug Mastriano.Pennsylvania State Senator Mastriano previously claimed the 2020 Presidential Election was \"compromised\" and the Republican indicated he wanted to overrule voters in the Keystone State.Mastriano's campaign against supposed election irregularities in Pennsylvania resulted in positive remarks from Donald Trump, who has continued to allege widespread voter fraud.\nPennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano speaks to supporters at a rally at the Wyndham Hotel in Pittsburgh on August 19, 2022. Mastriano now trails his Democratic rival Josh Shapiro in the polls. \nGetty\nDespite a lack of evidence to support the claim, the belief that the 2020 election was somehow stolen is now a shared belief among many Republicans who vocally support Trump.While Mastriano has won Trump's praise, poll tracker FiveThirtyEight shows five previous surveys found rival Shapiro has opened a solid lead over the GOP candidate.\nHowever, only the POS poll and one in July by Beacon Research/ Shaw and Company Research for Fox News were surveys with an A-grade or higher.FiveThirtyEight bases its rating on the historical accuracy and methodology of each polling organization's polls. A higher grade indicates the pollster has correctly called a result in the past and used relevant sample sizes.While there are months left in the Pennsylvania Governor's race, should the Democrats hold their lead it could bring into question the dominance of the MAGA movement within the GOP and the power of Trump's endorsement in swing states.\n\nThe same August 17 POS poll found Democrat U.S. Senate nominee for Pennsylvania John Fetterman holds a commanding lead over Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz of 33 to 51 percent.In Ohio, Democrat Tim Ryan holds a slim overall lead over GOP candidate J.D. Vance, despite an Emerson College poll this week putting the Republican ahead, according to FiveThirtyEight.In Arizona, Democrat Mark Kelly has consistently held a lead over MAGA candidate Blake Masters, a die-hard Trump supporter.The polling has tempered establishment Republicans' hopes for what had been forecast to be a bumper midterm election for the GOP.On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to take a dim view on whether the Republicans would capture the Senate.He also questioned the quality of GOP candidates going up against their Democrat counterparts.According to NBC News, McConnell said: \"Senate races are just different. They're statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.\"Democratic groups across the U.S. have poured tens of millions of dollars into supporting Republican primary candidates who hold hard to Trump's MAGA agenda, in an attempt to give their own candidates vulnerable opponents.The strategy holds that more right-wing Republicans will turn off moderate voters and give Democrats an edge in what they believe would be more competitive elections.Analysis by the National Journal found Democrats could have spent at least $20 million as part of the risky election strategy.Newsweek has contacted Shapiro and Mastriano for comment.\n  ",

        "date": 1661114422777,
        "title": "She was 69. He Was Young, Hunky—and a Fraud.",
        "content": "In May of last year, someone claiming to be a military doctor on a secret mission in North Korea contacted Laura Francis on Facebook, looking for love and connection. Francis, a California realtor, thought he was charming—his profile images portrayed a man with a muscular build, beard, tattoos, and hospital scrubs—but was initially skeptical of his intentions.The mystery man called himself “David Hodge,” and he claimed to be a kind of surgeon, helping soldiers who’d been injured by explosives in war. As part of his backstory, David told Francis he had an ex-wife who had cheated on him, and a 5-year-old son.David’s love-bombing of Francis, 69, was insistent. He texted Francis every morning and throughout the day (usually on Google Hangouts) and called her on the phone just as often. “I fell in love with his voice, he had the cutest laugh,” Francis recalls. He serenaded her with links to romantic songs on YouTube: “Hero” by Enrique Iglesias and “I Swear” by All-4-One.According to Francis, David said “he had been there and done that with the beautiful young women, and they were all not loyal.” He told her he “wanted somebody that was more mature.”“Meeting you was fate, becoming your friend was a choice but falling in love with you is beyond my control,” David wrote one evening in August 2021, as they discussed buying a wedding ring. Courtesy of Laura Francis “You have no idea how elaborate it was,” Francis told The Daily Beast in an interview, after she learned her nearly year-long affair with David wasn’t a real relationship but a cryptocurrency romance scam, one in which she claims she lost $248,000 of her savings—money that was supposed to be her daughter’s inheritance.“He had an excuse or an answer for every question,” Francis said. “I asked millions of questions. Because I didn’t trust or believe anything from the first.” Courtesy of Laura Francis Anytime Francis doubted him, David would send her photos he claimed were of himself, holding a sign that said: “I love you Laura and am not a scammer I’m Davidson Hodge.” He also sent her a purported passport and copies of a seemingly detailed bank statement, from a local bank in Columbus, Ohio—but which utilized a Chase Bank P.O. Box and which included some notable typos—claiming he had $3 million. He also sent her a photo of his arm, decked in military camouflage, and hand holding an “employment agreement” containing a U.S. Marine Corps logo.“Hunting down your stolen funds can be harder than actually finding true love.”Whenever he asked Francis for money, she says, he always promised to pay her back once he was out of the service and had access to his accounts.David directed her to use several Bitcoin apps including Coinbase and Coin Cloud Bitcoin ATMs until she cut him off in March. (The Daily Beast reviewed some of Francis’ Coin Cloud receipts with deposits totaling $37,080 in August 2021 alone, and one blockchain analytics firm said she appeared to have deposited around $60,000 via the ATM in September.)Asked for comment, Cloud Coin said its terms of service prevent it from sharing personal information about customers but said it has sympathy for the victims of financial crimes. “When a customer buys, the digital asset(s) go into their wallet,” the company said in a statement. “From there, we don’t know what a customer does with their currency, coin, or token.”Within three months, Francis was sucked into a whirlwind drama rivaling daytime soap operas. And each plot line drew her deeper into what she believed was true love, followed by a rift caused by a second alleged scammer named “Robert Manguire,” who claimed to be an oil rig worker in Louisiana and warned her David was a con artist.“Between the two of them, they had me on the run,” Francis said. David would tell her he was shunning her until she blocked Robert, and Robert threatened to tell her family about how much she’d paid David unless she blocked the supposed doctor.“I didn’t know how I was going to face my family,” she said, “and I did not know how I was ever going to let my family know how much money I lost.”Romance scams are big business in the U.S., and crypto is a growing piece of it. The FBI reported that Americans lost $1 billion to romance scammers in 2021, while the Federal Trade Commission estimated they lost $750 million to crypto scams that same year. (The FTC also said crypto was the second-most common form of payment in romance scams, above wire transfers and apps like Venmo.) Paul Sibenik, the lead case manager at CipherBlade, a company that helps track and recover stolen or scammed crypto, said anywhere from 30 to 40 percent of his company’s clients are victims of a romance scam.While the FBI began warning about Internet romance rackets as early 2005, the rise of cryptocurrency has made it even easier to scam money instantly, across borders, and without detection. And pandemic lockdowns meant more and more people turned to dating apps and websites as a means of finding love remotely. Romance scams hit a record high in 2021, according to the FTC, totaling more than any other category of fraud.The horror stories of courtship-based schemes increasingly involve crypto. In February, Nicole Hutchinson of Tennessee told CBS News that she lost $390,000 of her and her father’s money—some of it her inheritance after her mom died—after she fell for a scammer named “Hao” on the Hinge dating app. The man encouraged her to create an account on Crypto.com and instructed her to transfer funds to a link he claimed was a cryptocurrency exchange platform; instead, the money went into his pockets.Another victim, South Carolina business owner Zahra Hajiaghamohseni, told NBC affiliate WCBD-TV that she lost $350,000 after a handsome man wooed her online, then encouraged her to invest in crypto. She later learned her suitor had scammed her, using a fake identity and someone else’s photos, after she traveled to an airport to pick him up but he never arrived.The government has responded to this surge in crypto-related crimes by staffing up with investigators. The Securities and Exchange Commission nearly doubled the size of its Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit this spring, from 30 to 50, and the FBI announced a new Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit dedicated to blockchain analysis and virtual asset seizure. The Justice Department also launched two new crypto-related arms last year: one focusing on criminal money laundering and cybersecurity, and the other on civil fraud cases.“You have no idea how elaborate it was. He had an excuse or an answer for every question.”But the hires do not mean that every crypto fraud will be prosecuted. Several experts who spoke with The Daily Beast said federal law enforcement is unlikely to take cases where it deems the losses “too small”—a label some experts said can apply even to six-figure losses. Victims with smaller losses are directed to local police forces, which often do not have the training or tools to deal with a highly technical crime.There are other issues that complicate a crypto fraud investigation, the primary one being that the fraudsters could be anywhere in the world—far outside the jurisdiction of local police. They are also incredibly hard to identify, because, although all cryptocurrency transactions are made public on the blockchain, they occur anonymously, identified only by a long string of numbers designating a crypto “wallet.” Add to that the fact that many scammers use multiple wallets, or employ something called a “mixer” that combines their money with others to make it harder to track, and hunting down your stolen funds can be harder than actually finding true love.Going the civil route isn’t easy, either, according to Tal Lifshitz, a financial fraud attorney who also handles crypto cases. Tracking crypto transactions often involves expensive software or outside firms that cost more than a recently defrauded litigant can afford. And without those, it’s difficult for an attorney to know who to subpoena, or even serve.“With traditional financial fraud, we know there’s a bank [or accounting firm] involved,” Lifshitz said. “Even if you don’t necessarily have access to it before you bring a case, you know they exist, because they have to. None of those things have to exist in a crypto fraud.” Laura FrancisCourtesy of Laura Francis Francis says the first time David asked for money, he claimed his top-secret cover was blown and his military base was forced to relocate. As David and his crew members traveled up a river, he claimed, their boat overturned and they lost their belongings including cellphones. Francis says she paid $5,600 for a new phone for David, and while he was waiting for the device, paid two of his colleagues a total of $7,000 so he could borrow their phones. “He kept convincing me that where he was stationed and the conditions that he was living under were so dramatic, so iffy, so touch-and-go, we could be dead any minute,” she said.As they began to plan their future together, David suggested she buy her own engagement ring through a military program that would prove he had a fiancée and allow his release from his three-year military contract. She paid a total of $42,568 for a diamond ring—but when the band arrived in the mail, she saw it had a $9.99 price tag and was actually a chintzy cubic zirconia.The wedding ring wasn’t even enough to release David from his military tour, according to him. David told her “Shawn Porter,” a colleague he claimed handled the sale of military engagement rings, failed to send “paperwork” necessary to get him out, and the online couple had a fight.According to Francis, David and Shawn had instructed her to send money incrementally via a Coin Cloud Bitcoin ATM, which she’d visit sometimes three times a day. She says she would feed $100 bills into the machine to send to David as he stood by on the phone to walk her through the process. “It started out at $1,500 a day,” Francis recalled. “I got it to $25,000 a day that they allowed me to send. That’s how much business I gave that machine.”“I believed what the guy said, because I guess I wanted to. I wanted to hear the bullshit. I wanted to hear the niceness.”Messages show that in August 2021, David pushed Francis to withdraw more money from the bank to buy crypto. “Yes honey it’s night time here. You can still go to the bank though,” he tells her in one message, to which she replies, “I’m not gonna go to the bank and do that David I don’t think it’s necessary.”She added: “I’m not going to be sending money across the world much longer OK and I hope I don’t have to send any more damn bitcoins ever again.”Francis also questioned David on whether he was catfishing her, telling him: “I saw women give their whole life savings away to men like you they never met. And they were all deeply in love like I am.”“No it’s different,” David responded. “They don’t talk on phone they don’t get packages.”The realtor’s family members, who’d watched her fall deeper into texting David for hours each day, suggested she cut him off and meet someone in person on the dating website Plenty of Fish. That’s where she met Robert, an attractive older man with graying hair.Francis told Robert that she was seeing someone else, albeit online. “I really, really like him,” Francis says she told him. “But I think he’s lying to me.” Minutes after Francis sent Robert a photo of David, Robert messaged her with an Instagram profile that revealed David’s photos apparently belonged to another person in real life.Robert, Francis says, vowed to help her take down the scammer and get her money back. He claimed he could hack Shawn’s Bitcoin accounts and get the $42,000 she’d spent on the engagement ring. All she had to do, he said, was set up an account on a site called Cresco Trading Limited and pay the $37,000 in required fees. (A regulatory body in the U.K. issued a warning about Cresco in September 2021, saying it was “not authorised or registered by us but has been targeting people in the UK, claiming to be an authorised firm.”)Francis says she paid the initial fee but balked when a purported customer service agent for the site told her she needed to put the same amount of money in her Coinbase account to verify she had the funds. Francis refused, and turned back to David.The situation only got stranger from there. David, she said, claimed Francis had exposed his identity by talking about him with Robert online. Days later, Shawn messaged Francis and claimed David was arrested and it was all her fault.“Well, you blew it this time, Laura. David is in jail. They picked him up. Because Robert reported him. And they’re holding him on espionage and treason,” she recalls Shawn telling her.She says David contacted her from “jail,” crying and claiming he was being tortured in custody. Shawn told her David was only getting one meal a day, and was “suffering a lot,” according to messages reviewed by The Daily Beast. “Robert is the devil,” Shawn added. “He will have David killed if he had his way.”Desperate to help, Francis returned to Robert, and begged him to recant his report. At David’s urging, she even paid him the $56,000 he demanded to do so. At the same time, Robert sent Francis an email with a photo lineup from a law enforcement agency’s “wanted list”—apparently Photoshopped with Francis’ picture—warning that if she continued to associate with David, she’d end up on authorities’ radar.“I hope you listen this time or you end up behind bars,” one September 2021 email reviewed by The Daily Beast read. “If you disclose this to anyone you’re in for a big trouble.”To this day, Francis says, she doesn’t know how Robert found her on Plenty of Fish. She didn’t tell David she was moving on to the dating site, but says that she’s encountered other wannabe scammers seeking money on the platform recently. Indeed, authorities across the country have warned that dating apps are routinely used by swindlers in “pig butchering” scams, which combine a romance hoax and crypto investment scheme.“They probably were sitting in the same room, just playing me like a fiddle,” Francis said of David and Robert. “They both acted like they hated the other one.”For months, Francis still believed David was coming to America to be with her, until he asked for another $250,000 to get out of his military contract. When she told him she didn’t have that kind of money, he suggested she obtain a loan against her house to acquire the funds. “When I talked to him and he was willing to let me sell my home, yeah, okay, that’s it. You don’t care about me,” Francis recalled thinking.“I believed what the guy said, because I guess I wanted to,” Francis says now. “I wanted to hear the bullshit. I wanted to hear the niceness. And I’m just looking at some of the stuff he wrote to me and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I fell for that. I fell for that hook, line and sinker.’”Francis says she blocked David, but he kept contacting her via other accounts.Finally, she confided in her family about what happened, and her daughter sent her information about the online dating investigation service Social Catfish. She decided it was time to ask for help.Social Catfish is one of several emerging companies dedicated to tracking down sophisticated fraudsters where regular law enforcement cannot. Founded in 2013, the company started by investigating online love matches who daters thought might not be telling the whole truth, or even worse, lying about their identity. (The term “catfish” was popularized by a 2010 documentary about a man who starts dating a woman he met on Facebook who turned out to be faking her identity.) The company added a crypto investigations unit earlier this year, after seeing a “massive uptick” in the number of customers coming to them with crypto-related scams, according to President David McClellan.To help track down the perpetrators, Social Catfish partners with the Blockchain Intelligence Group, the creators of a proprietary software that both visualizes blockchain data and adds open-source and social media data on top of it. Instead of the endless spreadsheets that Bill Callahan, the director of government and strategic affairs at the group, used to receive in his job as a financial investigator at the DEA, his clients are handed what looks like a flowchart, showing which wallets the crypto was sent to and which it is being held in now.The software also helps identify whether the money has been sent to an “exchange”—a kind of trading platform for crypto—that law enforcement can subpoena or a private attorney can sue to get the funds back. And it pulls in open-source data, court records, and social media to try to identify the people behind the wallets, or see if they were tied to any other illegal activity.\"Every day our analysts are pulling in and ingesting information off of social media, off of the dark web—wherever illicit intelligence may be,” Callahan said. “And then we’re pulling in crypto intelligence, and then marrying it up.’“I want other women to know that this goes on. You're not above it. You would think that you’re smarter than this, because honestly, I thought I was smarter than this.”Social Catfish and Blockchain Intelligence Group aren’t alone in offering crypto sleuthing services. CipherBlade, a “Blockchain Intelligence Agency” with a logo that looks conspicuously like the CIA’s, was founded in 2017 by a former soldier named Rich Sanders, after he had some success helping friends who had had their crypto stolen. Now, the firm works on crypto-related crimes from investment fraud to romance scams to kidnappings, and even acts as an expert in civil and criminal cases, according to Sibenik, the lead case manager. (The largest percentage of their cases are divorces in which a partner thinks their estranged spouse is hiding crypto assets, he added.)TRM Labs, based in San Francisco, also offers software that helps track cryptocurrency transactions and identify the real people behind the anonymous wallets. Chris Janczewski, the company’s head of global investigations, said the group often works with law enforcement, as well as with major exchanges like FTX and Coinbase that want to prevent money laundering on their platforms. (Experts say their experience with other exchanges in this regard varies—some are reluctant to cooperate with investigators, seeing it as a business advantage to let the fraudsters continue to operate unchecked.)Janczewski, a former IRS special agent, sees his company as occupying the “gray zone” between cases big enough for the FBI or SEC to take over, and smaller ones that local law enforcement can’t handle on their own. “That’s one of the things that drew me to this position at TRM,” Janczewski said, “is that we can kind of help bridge that gap.”But experts warn that gap could expose victims to even more fraud. As Francis learned with “Robert,” some of the people claiming to help recover crypto are actually running scams of their own. Jan Santiago, deputy director Global Anti-Scam Organization, which assists victims of romance scams, said many of the sites that turn up in a typical Google search for crypto recovery agencies either outright steal money from their clients, or take money upfront and deliver unsatisfying returns.The truth is, most experts agree, even with a professional, well-respected crypto investigation company, the chances of getting your stolen funds back are slim.Francis first contacted Social Catfish via their YouTube channel, “Catfished,” where they post weekly videos about cases they helped solve. The team sent her a generic background form to fill out and asked for any pictures or evidence she had. They also set up a background call with Francis, and, after hearing her story, decided to dive in.First, the team searched the web for any hints of who the scammers could be. They plugged in the email addresses and phone numbers Francis had used to contact them, hoping that identifying information about them had been leaked in data breaches. (Most people’s numbers and email addresses will be the subject of some type of data leak if they use them for long enough.) The search turned up nothing, meaning the scammer had likely created the email account and secured the phone number shortly before contacting Francis.Then, Social Catfish employed a bit of subterfuge, getting Francis to send David a link to a website that she claimed would send him money via gift cards. (In a bit of foreshadowing the scammer missed, the website was called fyougiftcards.com.) Instead of sending him money, the website scraped David’s IP address and sent it to Social Catfish, giving them a vague idea of where in the world he lived: Not North Korea, but Nigeria.The company also took a record of all of Francis’s Bitcoin transfers, asking for the date, time, and wallet address for each transaction. They sent the information to the Blockchain Intelligence Group, which used its software to track the funds through a maze of 20 different wallets to one account on the world’s biggest crypto exchange: Binance. They then referred the case over to law enforcement, knowing that they would have the easiest time requesting the stolen funds from the exchange.But the company’s work wasn’t quite done. Since Francis had contacted them via their YouTube channel, they staged a viral-video-worthy confrontation between victim and scammer, getting Francis to call David and confront him about his lies on camera.“David, everything you’ve ever done and ever said to me was a lie,” Francis, then using the pseudonym “Karen,” fumed in the footage’s expletive-laden confrontation.“That’s bullshit,” a man with a foreign accent later replied.The video, “Woman loses $300k; gets engaged to scammer,” has more than 112,000 views.Francis says she contacted the FBI in California with the new information and for several weeks spoke to a local agent, who ultimately informed her the agency wouldn’t touch any case that didn’t result in at least a $500,000 loss. She filed a complaint with Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), as well as the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and the FTC. No agency has been able to take on her case.Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, couldn’t comment on Francis’ case but suggested victims file complaints on IC3’s website. She said the agency is unable to investigate every case “from a sheer resources standpoint,” or recover lost funds “particularly if the money is sent out of the country, which is why it is so important to educate the public about these schemes so they can identify the signs and avoid being victimized.”In an email, the EFCC told The Daily Beast that it received a petition from Francis and that an “investigation is ongoing.” The FTC didn’t return messages.“You have to lose a half a million dollars before they’ll take your case, even if you’re a little old lady, and they took your life savings,” Francis said. “That to me is not law enforcement. It’s not, I’m sorry. I got a problem with that.”In the meantime, Francis began to research similar online scams and bonded with others who’d fallen prey to fake suitors on Facebook groups like ScamHaters United.“I want other women to know that this goes on,” Francis told The Daily Beast. “You're not above it. You would think that you’re smarter than this, because honestly, I thought I was smarter than this. But guess what? I wasn’t. They got me. It doesn't feel good to get gotten.”She’s still processing the deceit. “He broke my heart,” Francis said. “I was crushed. Devastated, cried, cried so many nights. And for someone I’ve never even met.”“It’s amazing. The heart, when you feel that deeply, it just counteracts the brain completely.”",

        "title": "Darya Dugina: Daughter of Putin ally killed in Moscow blast",
        "content": "By Leo SandsBBC NewsImage source, ReutersImage caption, Darya Dugina was vocal in her support for the Russian government over the invasion of UkraineThe daughter of a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin has been killed in a suspected car bombing.Darya Dugina, 29, died after an explosion on a road outside Moscow, Russia's investigative committee said.It is thought her father, the Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, who is known as \"Putin's brain\", may have been the intended target of the attack.Mr Dugin is a prominent ultra-nationalist ideologue who is believed to be close to the Russian president.Alexander Dugin and his daughter had been at a festival near Moscow, where the philosopher gave a lecture on Saturday evening. The \"Tradition\" festival describes itself as a family event for art lovers which takes place at the Zakharovo estate, where Russian poet Alexander Pushkin once stayed.The pair were due to leave the venue in the same car, before Mr Dugin reportedly made a decision at the last minute to travel separately.Image caption, Alexander Dugin is credited with shaping President Vladimir Putin's worldviewFootage posted on Telegram appears to show Mr Dugin watching in shock as emergency services arrive at the scene of the burning wreck of a vehicle.Investigators confirmed that Ms Dugina, who was driving the car, died at the scene near the village of Bolshiye Vyazemy.They said an explosive device planted under the car went off and the vehicle caught fire. Forensic and explosive experts are investigating. A Ukrainian official has dismissed accusations of Ukrainian involvement in the incident.\"Ukraine, of course, has nothing to do with this, because we are not a criminal state, which is the Russian Federation, and even less a terrorist state,\" said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky.Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, said in a Telegram post that if any Ukrainian link was found it would amount to \"state terrorism\".Analysis By Will Vernon, BBC MoscowWhile Alexander Dugin is not a state official himself, he is nevertheless a symbolic figure in Russian politics. His anti-Western, ultranationalist philosophy has become the dominant political ideology in Russia and has helped shape President Putin's expansionist foreign policy, most prominently on Ukraine.Attention will now turn to who was behind this attack. Denis Pushilin, the \"head\" of the self-declared pro-Russian \"Donetsk People's Republic\", has already laid the blame on Ukraine, writing on Telegram: \"Vile villains! The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin, blew up his daughter… In a car. We cherish the memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl!\"Incidents like this will make officials in Moscow nervous, especially in the aftermath of a series of explosions and attacks in occupied Crimea and in Russian regions near the border with Ukraine. Kremlin propaganda consistently stresses how Vladimir Putin has brought security and stability in Russia following the turbulent 1990s, when car bombs and assassinations were commonplace.  This car bomb in the Russian capital undermines that narrative. Despite not holding an official position in government, Alexander Dugin is believed to be a close ally of the Russian president and has even been branded \"Putin's Rasputin\".Darya Dugina was herself a prominent journalist who vocally supported the invasion of Ukraine.Earlier this year she was sanctioned by US and UK authorities, who accused her of contributing to online \"disinformation\" about Russia's invasion.In May, she described the war as a \"clash of civilisations\" in an interview and expressed pride in the fact that both she and her father had been targeted by Western sanctions.Image source, Investigative Committee of the Russian FederationImage caption, Russian investigators at the scene of the vehicle explosionAlexander Dugin was sanctioned by the US in 2015 for his alleged involvement in Russia's annexation of Crimea.His writings are said to have had a deep influence on Mr Putin and the philosopher is regarded as a chief architect of the ultra-nationalist ideology endorsed by many in the Kremlin.For years, Mr Dugin has called on Moscow to assert itself more aggressively on the global stage and has supported Russian military action in Ukraine.

        "title": "More Boogaloo Bois Are Heading to Ukraine to Fight",
        "content": "Since the war in Ukraine began, some young Americans have rolled into towns there, waving flags with tropical prints. Local soldiers have sometimes assumed the foreign fighters had traveled all the way from Hawaii to join the fight against the Russian invasion.But in reality, those flags have nothing to do with Hawaii. They’re the symbol of the American “Boogaloo” movement, a sprawling network of anti-government extremists, militiamen, and far-right members. The movement made its way offline and onto American streets in early 2020, when groups of young men in Hawaiian shirts carrying AR-style rifles started showing up to anti-lockdown protests.Since the “Boogaloo”—memespeak for a violent uprising or civil war—failed to materialize in the U.S., some of the movement’s adherents sought battle experience elsewhere: Ukraine. VICE News has learned that 10 so-called “Boogaloo Bois” are preparing to deploy from the U.S. to Ukraine in the coming weeks, just as government agencies worry that American far-right extremists traveling to the conflict for combat experience could become national security threats upon their return. Vouching for them is Mike Dunn, a 21-year-old from Virginia, who was considered a leader in the Boogaloo movement and has been embroiled in the conflict in Ukraine since April. Until recently, he was recovering in a Ukrainian military hospital after his brigade came under heavy artillery in July, leading to fatalities, while defending a village in the Donetsk region. “I’ve met a couple of Americans here that are active Boogaloo Bois, and I have more Boogaloo Bois that will be arriving here,” Dunn told VICE News.“They’ll be going through background checks and processing into whatever unit picks them,” Dunn said. “Whenever a unit takes them, they’ll process into and start fighting, to either get experience or to reignite some type of passion in their lives, for the excitement, I guess.” Dunn, who’s a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps (and was discharged for a medical condition), said it was the same incident that killed two Americans, a Swede, and a Canadian in one of the worst incidents for foreign fighters since the war in Ukraine began, in late February. Dunn says he was part of a combat support unit made up entirely of foreign fighters attached to the 79th Brigade, a paratrooper group in the Ukrainian special forces. In his telling, a Russian advance pierced the lines of the 79th in the Donetsk region, and his unit was dispatched to stem it but was ambushed in the process.Dunn said several nationalities were represented among the foreign fighters he works with. The International Legion, a section of the Ukrainian military set up to process international volunteers and train them, officially states that foreign fighters come from at least 55 countries, with the U.S. and U.K. supplying the largest contingents.“Whenever a unit takes them, they’ll process into and start fighting, to either get experience or to reignite some type of passion in their lives, for the excitement, I guess.”For years, experts have warned that the war in Ukraine—which was, for a time, a frozen trench conflict isolated to Donbas—could become a training ground and terrorist hotbed for the global far-right movement. Azov Battalion, an ultranationalist unit within the Ukrainian military, is dogged by its connections to neo-Nazism and the global far-right. So far, no strong evidence suggests the latest phase of the war has attracted scores of neo-Nazis or right-wing extremists to fight for Ukraine. Yet the problem remains on the Ukrainian government’s radar. In 2019, while the conflict was still simmering in Donbas, Ukrainian intelligence deported two American foreign fighters—one a Marine dropout and also a former member of designated terror group The Base—for their far-right terrorist activities in the country.In recent months, U.S. government agencies have been expressing concern about the possible national security risk posed by American foreign fighters when they return home with combat experience—particularly those with ties to extremist networks. A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) intelligence bulletin from March describes how far-right extremists and other “individuals in the United States and Europe announced intentions to join the conflict,” citing extremists who had been questioned as they left for Ukraine from JFK Airport in New York. The bulletin also flagged that the Azov Battalion is a heavy recruiter of far-right travelers into their ranks.“What kind of training are foreign fighters receiving in Ukraine that they could possibly proliferate in U.S.-based militia and white nationalist groups?” the report asked in its conclusion.Joshua Fisher-Birch, an expert and analyst on the far-right at the Counter-Extremism Project, said some extremists may see the conflict as a chance to become battle hardened and gain military skills.“Some right-wing extremists have viewed the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to gain critical combat experience which would otherwise be unavailable to them,” said Fisher-Birch, pointing out that war experience can also help boost their cachet within the movement at home. “Combat experience not only serves the purpose of increasing their own capabilities but passing those skill sets along to others in their movement.”​​Dunn got his start in anti-government organizing in late 2019, when he latched onto anger simmering among pro–Second Amendment Virginians over proposed state gun control legislation and participated in efforts to form county-level militias in response. In 2020, Dunn tried to position himself as a kingpin of the surging Boogaloo movement. But a year later, with the Boogaloo and its adherents under heavy government scrutiny, Dunn and others left the movement. Dunn deleted his social media accounts, changed his phone number, and retreated from the public persona he’d built around himself. He got a job as a guard at a prison in Virginia and lay low for a while. Then the war broke out in Ukraine—and foreign fighters were being encouraged to join the fight. Suddenly, Dunn wanted to put his Hawaiian shirt back on. “The day that the invasion happened, Mike [Dunn] and I were on the phone, just buzzing back and forth,” said Ken, one of the Boogaloo Bois who is deploying to Ukraine this month. Mike Dunn, leader of the Last Son's of Liberty, which is part of the boogaloo movement, attends a Lobby Day 2021 event in Richmond, Va. Monday Jan. 18, 2021. (AP Photo/John C. Clark)Ken, 29, asked that his full name be withhold from this story. He’s been a central figure in the Boogaloo movement from its inception, though he’s not as public-facing as Dunn. (He says he ran one of its biggest meme pages on Facebook, “Swamp Mountain Boogaloo,” before it got shut down by the social media company and claims it had around 100,000 followers.) Only days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Dunn set about making plans to travel overseas. He said he was able to expedite a passport. He and a fellow Boogaloo Boi from Ohio, Henry Hoeft, even gave media interviews about their upcoming deployment. But they weren’t there for long. Hoeft returned to the U.S. after just two weeks and posted a video explaining his reasons for leaving: that foreign fighters were being used as cannon fodder and sent into tense conflict zones like in Kyiv at the height of the bombing and ground assaults on the Ukraine capital, without proper gear or weapons. It was a very common complaint among the early waves of foreign fighters, who didn’t realize how intense the fighting was or the scarcity of resources facing a Ukrainian military that was resisting a far superior Russian army. One Ukrainian special forces soldier told VICE News he understood the frustrations of some foreign fighters during those early stages of the Russian invasion.“Of course, some [foreign fighters] were disappointed with some problems with our management, commanders, and bureaucracy,” he said. “I can understand them. Sometimes,  they don't get necessary weapons or other equipment, sometimes there are some doubts about the missions.”In online posts, other foreign fighters widely ridiculed Hoeft for leaving. Dunn, who was embedded with the Georgian National Legion at the time, says he initially left because he wanted to attend his sister’s wedding. He returned in April, and when he did, this time Dunn said he was able to link up to a more elite branch of the Ukrainian war effort: a special forces group. At the outset of the war in February, some Western veterans and volunteers with real combat skills or special forces training were put under the command of the Ukrainian special forces branch, something that Kyiv wasn’t even shy about discussing at the time.The CBP intelligence bulletin indicated that many of the extremists the agency feared were heading to Ukraine to fight had gotten detailed instructions on how to officially enter the country through Ukrainian government channels. The bulletin also raised the possibility that these extremists were relying on specific “websites or chat rooms” to help them obtain contacts on the ground in Ukraine. Now, Dunn says he’s helping to set up his own pipeline for other Boogaloos to join him in Ukraine. He also runs a TikTok account called “Armed and Dedicated,” where he’s posting updates and documenting life in Ukraine. He’s racked up 5,000 followers and amassed more than 160,000 views on one of his videos, where he talks about the deadly ambush that left him injured and four of his fellow foreign fighters dead. “Rest in peace,” he says to the camera. “We took artillery and mortar to our position, just couldn't move. I’m alive, my team is alive, we had a good firefight with the Russians out of sight. They suffered losses and retreated.” He was treated for a concussion. Though Dunn doesn’t explicitly identify himself as a Boogaloo Boi in his TikTok, he’s remained influential in the world of young anti-government extremists, according to Ken.Ken, who has been friends with Dunn for years, worries that Dunn has made himself a target by being so visible on his TikTok—and inspiring other young foreign fighters to come to Ukraine and join the fray. “The shit I’ve seen that kid do, he’s a fucking degenerate. I love him to death… He’s a fucking animal, and I love him,” Ken said. “A lot of people look up to him, and a lot of guys are going over there, I’m sure, because of him.” “If they [the Russian military] were to knock him off or make an example of him, that would stop that in a fucking heartbeat, for a lot of them anyway,” he added. It’s not immediately obvious what the ideological interest in Ukraine is for the Boogaloo movement, which has always been so laser-focused on grievances against the U.S. government. Ken doesn’t personally know all of the other nine Boogaloo Bois who are headed to Ukraine, but he’s not particularly concerned about whether any in the group might be loose cannons. “If you have a proclivity towards violence, if you’re mean in general, if you are bad, then [Ukraine] is probably the place for you,” he said. “If you’re a bad guy with some semblance of a moral compass, then you’re probably right at home.”A weapon on a demonstrator is seen during a gun rights rally outside of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Virginia on January 17, 2022 (Photo by Bryan Dozier/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)It was similar for Dunn. Asked whether he was concerned that he was helping bring over guys who were already radicalized, and whose only interest in the conflict was that they wanted to engage in violence, Dunn shrugged. “How is that a liability for me?” Dunn said. “Because they’re going to get it. Nor is he particularly worried about whether any of the Boogaloo Bois coming to Ukraine could wind up posing a national security risk once they return to the U.S. “What about when anybody goes back to the U.S.?” Dunn said. “It’s not just Boogaloo Bois. Every war we’ve been involved in, you’ve had to worry about people coming back.”“I’ll say something I said to you two years ago,” Dunn added, referring to an interview with VICE News from 2020. “It is what it is.”Dunn sees his band of Boogaloos as international freedom fighters. “The Boogaloo, regardless of what it is against the U.S. government, it’s always been about standing up for those who can’t stand up for themselves,” Dunn said. Ken believes there are similarities between the U.S. and the Russian Federation. “I will say that the enemy of my enemy is not always my friend,” he said. “Not that I’m going to publicly announce that I’m an enemy of the U.S. government. If I want to get on an airplane in the future, I’d probably better not say that in public. But it’s the same. A lot of the same grievances I would air with our own government are simply applicable to the Russian Federation.” Ken, who served as an electronics technician in the U.S. Navy, told VICE News that he is trying to keep his ideological affiliations under wraps until he makes it over there. “I’m more worried about U.S. Customs and TSA than I am the Russians,” said Ken. “The last thing I want is them to find my igloo flag folded up in my suitcase and pull me into the office to detain me and question me about it. (The Boogaloo movement adopted igloos as one of their symbols in 2020: “Big Igloo” is a homophone of Boogaloo, so they used this term to skirt social media crackdowns.) Ken is planning to go to Ukraine for only two months, but he expects that the U.S. federal authorities will be keeping tabs on him. “It’s entirely legal to go engage in combat with the Russian Federation and not on U.S. soil,” Ken said. “But am I expecting a visit when I get back? Yeah, I'm expecting a knock on the door and they’ll want to ask me questions. And I’m going to invoke the Fifth, and tell them that I have a very polite attorney that they’re welcome to speak to. And that’s that.” Similarly, Dunn said he became aware that the U.S. government was tracking him in May, when Politico published the same declassified CBP intelligence bulletin (which a civil liberties group first obtained), about American citizens who had traveled abroad to fight in Ukraine. Dunn believes he’s one of the subjects CBP officers describe in the document: “Sub1” at JFK Airport. He was headed to Warsaw, Poland, flying via Helsinki, Finland. They asked him about his status as a leader in the Boogaloo movement. He told agents that he had “not been involved with the group for almost a year due to the direction they were headed in.” CBP told VICE News it wouldn’t comment on any cases of foreign fighters in Ukraine, even those individuals described in the bulletin.“Due to privacy laws, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is prohibited from discussing the details of an individual U.S. citizen or traveler’s inspection, travel history or immigration status,” a CBP spokesperson said in a statement. Fisher-Birch did note that the initial surge in chatter from far-right groups about going to Ukraine to fight has subsided somewhat since February. “In the U.S., the extreme right has been less vocal over time in suggesting that their members or supporters become foreign fighters and has focused more on the domestic situation in the U.S. and maintaining unity within their movements,” he said, warning that the Kremlin has used mistruths about foreign fighters to justify its invasion. “It must also be stated that the myth of a flood of extremist fighters to Ukraine is Russian government propaganda and does not reflect the actual situation.”The Boogaloo Bois’ involvement in Ukraine, in particular, may pique the interest of U.S. officials. The movement has been in federal agencies’ line of sight since it spent much of the year 2020 plotting anarchy and violence against the U.S. government, starting with anti-lockdown protests. This was the militia movement on steroids—and with memes. Their online conversations were awash in fierce anti-government rhetoric, often tongue-in-cheek, advocating violence against the state. “It’s entirely legal to go engage in combat with the Russian Federation and not on U.S. soil. But am I expecting a visit when I get back? Yeah.”Months later, the Boogaloo movement latched onto the national unrest after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Boogaloo Bois tried to present themselves as allies to Black Lives Matter activists demanding justice for Floyd and other Black victims of police brutality. However, it became clear that the true intention of many in the movement was to advance their own broader goals of anarchy and societal collapse. Individuals with ties to the Boogaloo movement were linked to a string of violent plots and incidents that year: a fatal ambush on a federal security officer in Oakland, a plot to bomb an electrical substation in Nevada, shooting at a police station in Minneapolis during ongoing protests, and even the alleged plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan in revenge for the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. A few Boogaloo Bois, including Dunn, even showed up on Jan. 6 at the Capitol (though he insists he never went inside and has never been charged with anything in relation). At that time, a schism was forming in the Boogaloo movement. Some felt like the joke had gone too far and they’d gotten in over their heads. As one former Boogaloo Boi who goes by “Scrappy” and plans to travel to Ukraine this fall described it, “more extremist-type people came in and ruined the group.” “You had guys that came in that were saying that they wanted to blow stuff up or shoot people,” said Scrappy, 20. “And I left the group because I didn't want to go to jail. I didn't want to get in trouble.” He claims he even got a visit from the FBI.  “I was just a kid at the time,” said Scrappy, who works as a mechanic in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “In all honesty, nowadays it's a terrorist organization that doesn't commit acts of terror.” Despite having no interest in aligning himself with the Boogaloo movement, Scrappy says he fully anticipates that the U.S. government will be monitoring him, especially given he was already on the FBI’s radar to begin with. “I understand why they would, they have every reason to because I was part of an extremist group at one point. That’s absolutely a fair observation,” Scrappy said. “And I wish they would investigate me further just in case. You know, I’m not saying that anything’s going to happen, but they have a job to do at the end of the day.” Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.",

The chain is exploring ways to cut costs to keep prices in reach.\n        \n            \n            Courtesy of Victor Garcia\n            \n        \n    \n   \n   With inflation near a four-decade high, American shoppers are watching their pennies and adjusting their spending habits – and the businesses that cater to them are taking notice.   The change in spending is affecting retailers across the country, from giants like Walmart to the neighborhood supermarket, as they look for ways to deliver more affordable products to their customers.    Here are four examples of what businesses across America are seeing, and how they are adjusting to the new shopping reality.   \n   \n\n   The family supermarket that's offering gas promotions   Tom Charley's family has been selling groceries in the Pittsburgh area for four generations, through lots of economic ups and downs. Even his father, who ran stores during the high inflation of the 1970s and '80s has never seen a period quite like this.   \"It's a challenge, for sure. There's no doubt about it,\" Tom Charley says.   The three Charley Family Shop N Save markets have long prided themselves on high-quality service, with in-store butchers and bakeries. But today, the company's newspaper ads are more likely to highlight discounts on yogurt than premium, hand-cut steaks.    \n   \"We are as focused today as we've ever been on price and making sure we can get items that people care about at the best price possible,\" Charley says.    That means beating the bushes for lower prices on everything from bananas to the plastic wrap used to package prepared foods. Even as shoppers are trying to save money, Charley says, they still want the ease that comes with pre-cut vegetables or market-crafted kebabs.     \"Convenience is king,\" Charley says. \"They want it more and more every day.\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tom Charley (left) and his family run three Shop N Save supermarkets outside Pittsburgh. Their establishments pride themselves on in-store butchers and bakeries. But these days, their weekly newspaper ads are more likely to feature discount items than high-end steaks.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Tom Charley \n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Courtesy of Tom Charley \n        \n    \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        Tom Charley (left) and his family run three Shop N Save supermarkets outside Pittsburgh. Their establishments pride themselves on in-store butchers and bakeries. But these days, their weekly newspaper ads are more likely to feature discount items than high-end steaks.\n        \n            \n            Courtesy of Tom Charley \n            \n        \n    \n   \n   That's labor intensive for the supermarkets, which employ more than 200 people. But they still have to be cost competitive, especially now, when grocery prices have been climbing at a double-digit annual rate.   \"We've never said we're going to be the cheapest,\" Charley says. \"And we've also never said we're going to be the Whole Foods of the market.\"    Charley's supermarkets get a lot of mileage from offering a discount at the gas station through a promotional tie-in with Sunoco. Customers save 10 cents a gallon on gasoline for every $50 they spend on groceries.    \"Our customers love that promotion,\" Charley says. \"Everyone I know that  shops in my store uses it.\"    Cheaper train sets and hunting for used models   The Smoke Stack Hobby Shop in Lancaster, Ohio, sells train sets, radio-controlled cars and model airplanes. Sales boomed early in the pandemic when many people were looking for ways to entertain themselves at home. But some of the most elaborate model kits, priced at $70 or more, are now out of reach for some customers.   \n   \"Once you hit past the $50 mark, somebody has to think long and hard about buying a kit like that,\" says Patti Riordan, who runs the store with her husband, Don. \"So we're still going to get some of those high-end ones, but it's definitely going to be a lot less.\"    Instead, Riordan is stocking more mid-priced models, which sell for around $35. And a growing share of her sales now comes from used items that another hobbyist has sold or traded in.   \"We buy a lot of collections so people can buy a model kit or some rolling stock for their train layout at a fraction of the cost of new,\" Riordan says. \"And that's been a big sustainer for folks this year.\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Patti Riordan runs the Smoke Stack Hobby Shop in Lancaster, Ohio, with her husband Don. The store has scaled back its selection of higher-priced models to focus on more affordable items as well as second-hand merchandise.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Don Riordan/Courtesy of Patti Riordan\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Don Riordan/Courtesy of Patti Riordan\n        \n    \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        Patti Riordan runs the Smoke Stack Hobby Shop in Lancaster, Ohio, with her husband Don. The store has scaled back its selection of higher-priced models to focus on more affordable items as well as second-hand merchandise.\n        \n            \n            Don Riordan/Courtesy of Patti Riordan\n            \n        \n    \n   \n   Riordan says while finding and pricing used hobby items is a lot of work, it's gratifying when old railroad cars or other items find new owners.    \"It's a nice way to recycle that stuff,\" Riordan says. \"It really allows a lot more flexibility to keep the shop going. And that, I think, gives us the strength to weather through some of these things.\"    \n   \n\n   Ice cream at smaller portions – and lower prices   Victor Garcia runs a Mexican-style ice cream company in the Fort Worth area that specializes in flavors like mango, tres leches and tequila.    \"Our whole mission is to make people happy by sharing a piece of our Mexican culture,\" he says.    This summer, Garcia noticed some customers at his SolDias stores were downsizing their orders, perhaps buying just one item instead of two. The average transaction dropped from $13.50 to about $12.25.    \"That kind of was the first indicator that maybe a recession is coming,\" Garcia says. \"And we do have to be a little more flexible with our budget-conscious consumers.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Customers at the SolDias ice cream shops in the Dallas-Fort Worth area began dialing back their purchases this summer, sometimes buying one item instead of two. The company has started offering smaller portions to keep prices affordable.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Victor Garcia\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Courtesy of Victor Garcia\n        \n    \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        Customers at the SolDias ice cream shops in the Dallas-Fort Worth area began dialing back their purchases this summer, sometimes buying one item instead of two. The company has started offering smaller portions to keep prices affordable.\n        \n            \n            Courtesy of Victor Garcia\n            \n        \n    \n   \n   Garcia has started offering smaller portion sizes at lower prices. He's also hunting for cheaper paper suppliers and exploring whether he could cut costs by moving more of the ice cream manufacturing process in-house.    \"At the end of the day, what we don't want is customers saying, 'That place is outside of our budget,'\" Garcia said. \"It's up to us as the businesses to really listen and pivot and give the customer the experience they want.\"   More hot dog sales, fewer deli meats at Walmart   Walmart reported a drop in quarterly earnings this past week, saying cash-strapped shoppers have been trading down and filling their shopping carts with less expensive items as they've grown more sensitive to rising food prices.    \"As an example, instead of deli meats at higher price points, customers are increasing purchases of hot dogs as well as canned tuna or chicken,\" says chief financial officer John David Rainey.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Shopping carts with the Walmart logo are seen outside a Walmart store in Burbank, Calif. on Aug. 15. Walmart experienced a decline in earnings in the most recent quarter.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n        \n    \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        Shopping carts with the Walmart logo are seen outside a Walmart store in Burbank, Calif. on Aug. 15. Walmart experienced a decline in earnings in the most recent quarter.\n        \n            \n            Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n            \n        \n    \n   \n   Cash-strapped shoppers are also opting for more private-label products, rather than brand-named goods.  And in some cases they're having to get by with smaller package sizes.    Walmart says so far, back-to-school sales have been strong. But customers are wary about spending outside the grocery aisle.  That's forced the retailer to offer deeper discounts on other merchandise as it tries to unload unwanted inventory.    At the same time, Walmart says it's seeing increased traffic from upper-income shoppers, who are turning to the discount chain in search of bargains. \n",

        "title": "The Colorado River drought is coming for your winter veggies",
        "content": "\n  It’s a classic Italian-American meal: a crispy Caesar salad with a plate of marinara pasta.\nYou can find it in restaurants across the country, but depending on the time of year, many of the ingredients come from just one region. Yuma, Arizona, along with California’s Imperial Valley, produces more than 90 percent of the country’s winter leafy greens and much of its vegetables. Arizona is also a major grower of wheat, which the state exports to Italy for making pasta.\nHistorically, this made a lot of sense. The region has nutritious soil and a warm climate for growing food year-round, even when the rest of the country is frozen over. \nThere’s just one problem: The water that farmers use to grow these crops comes from the Colorado River, and the Colorado River is drying up. \nThe iconic river is in its 23rd year of drought, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, and the two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have sunk to historic lows, prompting a series of water restrictions. Under climate change, the drought could worsen in the years ahead. \nThat means residents in the West might have less water for lawns and long showers, but it’s a much bigger problem for agriculture because farmers use about three-quarters of all the water that people take from the river. Some farmers have already had to restrict their water supply, and there are much steeper cuts to come. \nWhich brings us to this slightly depressing point: When farmers use less water, they tend to produce less food. And that could cause food prices to go up, even more than they already have. Winter veggies, like lettuce and broccoli, could take a big hit, as could Arizona’s delectable wheat. More concerning still is that the shrinking Colorado River is just one of many climate-related disasters that are threatening the supply and affordability of food. \nHistoric water cuts are already hitting farmers\nMeandering 1,450 miles from northern Colorado to the Gulf of California, the Colorado River is the lifeblood of the American West. It provides water to nearly 40 million people across seven states, Mexico, and more than two dozen tribes, and it irrigates millions of acres of land.\nThe river is governed by a complex set of policies — collectively known as the Law of the River — that dictate how much water each state or tribe receives, and which will lose water first when the government imposes restrictions. (Typically, groups that have been using the water for longer have higher-priority water rights, including Indigenous tribes.)\nLast August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the river for the first time, in response to projections that Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, would be at just 34 percent of its capacity by the end of 2020. The declaration, known as a Tier 1 shortage, triggered cuts that affected Central Arizona, which has low-priority rights. \nFarmers in Pinal County, Arizona, who grow alfalfa, wheat, and other crops, suffered the most, said Paul Brierley, a former farmer who now leads the Yuma Center of Excellence for Desert Agriculture at the University of Arizona. “They’ve had to fallow [stop planting] about 40 percent of their acreage because they lost all their Colorado River water,” he said. \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Fallowed farmland north of Kingman, Arizona, in June 2021.\n      \n      \n        David McNew/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nA withering alfalfa crop could rattle the local dairy industry, Brierley said. Dairy farmers use the flowering plant to feed cows, and when water restrictions take effect, alfalfa is one of the first crops they stop planting. \nThe Tier 1 shortage, alone, may cause prices of milk, yogurt, and other products to spike, at least in Arizona. But as of this summer, the river is already beyond a Tier 1 shortage, and states are facing additional cuts. The impacts could be much farther reaching. \nLess water could mean more expensive food\nThis summer, the water level in Lake Mead reached a record low of just 1,042 feet above sea level (it was around 1,200 feet above sea level in 2000). The reservoir is now just over a quarter full. If it drops much lower, the reservoir could hit “dead pool” status, meaning that water can’t travel downstream through the Hoover Dam, let alone generate electricity.\n“Without action, we cannot protect the system and the millions of Americans who rely on this critical resource,” Bureau of Reclamation commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said on a call with reporters earlier this week. \nOn the call, Touton declared the first-ever Tier 2 shortage, which triggers additional cuts that impact Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico. \nHer announcement followed a Senate hearing in June, in which she advised officials in the seven states that use water from the Colorado River to come up with a plan to cut an additional 2 million to 4 million acre-feet from their supply, on top of the Tier 2 cuts. (An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to fill an acre with one foot of water.)\nThat does not bode well for farmers and those of us who buy their products. While previous cuts have caused some disruptions in Central Arizona, the impact of a 2-4 million acre-foot reduction — or up to 25 percent of what the basin states currently use — will be more widespread. Withholding that water will likely affect farms in Yuma, the Imperial Valley of Southern California, and other epicenters of food production. \n“The [food] system can adapt, but 2-4 million is really a game changer,” said George Frisvold, an agriculture economist at the University of Arizona. “If it gets to the point where people actually have to start cutting back on veggie production, then you’re going to see price increases.”\n\nThe first crops to get hit — other than alfalfa and other animal fodder — will likely be produce that farmers plant annually (or more often) like lettuce, broccoli, and tomatoes. These are short-term investments and farmers can decide whether or not to plant them on a yearly basis. \nIn contrast, many fruits, nuts, and other tree crops are longer-term bets that can take years to pay off and tend to be more valuable. Farmers are not going to let, say, almond trees wilt if they can avoid it.\n“When water supplies aren’t available, farmers have to make decisions on what they can and can’t plant,” said Mike Wade, executive director of the nonprofit California Farm Water Coalition. \nConsider a farmer that grows processing tomatoes in California for foods like ketchup or marinara, Wade said. If there isn’t enough water for the growing season, the farmer might not even put the plants in the ground. “Then the supply is reduced to the cannery, which has the effect of increasing prices down the line,” Wade said. “That makes the products that consumers buy in the store more expensive.” \nWater cuts could also hurt wheat production in Arizona, said Jeffrey Silvertooth, a plant and soil scientist at the University of Arizona. The region is a major supplier of durum wheat to Italian pasta companies, he said. \nIf a farmer has 20 percent less water, they may choose to leave the ground fallow in the winter instead of planting wheat, Brierley said. “That’s a rational decision that would impact the supply of wheat. And it’s not a good time to produce less wheat,” he added, nodding at the war in Ukraine, one of the world’s largest wheat producers, which has already constricted supply of the grain.\nShould you be worried? \nThe good news is that, on its own, the drought-related supply squeeze isn’t likely to translate to enormous price increases, Frisvold said. A head of lettuce isn’t going to double in price overnight. A box of dried pasta probably won’t bankrupt you. \nOnly a portion of the retail price of food is tied to the cost of actually growing it, and thus, to supply; the rest is related to things like marketing and transportation. \nPlus, although plenty of food does depend on the Colorado River, there are farms elsewhere, such as in Iowa, that can help meet demand. When the price of certain crops goes up, farmers in other regions start planting them, said Frank Ward, an agriculture economist at New Mexico State University. \nSo, in a sense, our food system is resilient. \nWhat’s concerning, however, is that drought along the Colorado River isn’t the only disaster that’s straining our food supply. Earlier this summer, an extreme heat wave in the Midwest caused corn to wilt and cattle to die. Meanwhile, another heat wave in India strangled the supply of wheat. That’s on top of supply chain issues linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n“It’s kind of like death by a thousand cuts,” Frisvold said. \nTogether, these threats — many of which are worsened by climate change, and accelerating — can destabilize the global supply of food and send prices soaring. They’re part of the reason why you’re paying 13 percent more for groceries this summer, compared to last year.  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Workers inspect an irrigation system on a broccoli farm in Imperial Valley, California, in October 2011.\n      \n      \n        Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nToward a more stable (and affordable) supply of food\nIf water is running out, one solution is to simply use less of it. Farmers can switch to crops that aren’t as thirsty — from pecans to grapes, for example — or use technologies to water their crops more precisely. \nMore environmentally friendly styles of agriculture can also help farms survive extreme drought. Planting cover crops, for example, helps lock moisture in the soil, and switching to an agroforestry-style farm, where trees are integrated into the landscape, can provide valuable shade.  \nThese changes come at a cost, but the federal government is willing to help pay for at least some of them. The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law earlier this week, includes nearly $20 billion for farmland conservation and $4 billion for drought relief in the West. The federal spending on drought may help compensate farmers for water cuts and help them develop more efficient farms, Brierley said. \nBut ultimately, the US will have to do much more to ensure a stable and affordable supply of food. Drought is a problem, yes, but it’s linked to the much bigger issue of climate change. Without swiftly curtailing carbon emissions, responding to the shrinking Colorado River is just a temporary fix. \n  \n\n",

        "title": "For the MAGA Right, Democracy Itself Is a Fraud",
        "content": "  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n          \n                   \n          \n            \n              \n                  A Trump supporter protests Biden’s inauguration outside the Arizona State Capitol in 2021.\n                Photo: The Washington Post/The Washington Post via Getty Im\n              \n            \n              \n            One of the maddening things about Donald Trump’s insistence that the 2020 election was “stolen” is that no proof of election fraud is required to sustain the lie. Among the former president’s supporters, election denial is practically an article of faith; it relies more on conspiracy theories and mistrust of Trump’s enemies than any demonstrable facts. That’s why Trump can blithely assert not only that he won the 2020 election but that it was a historic landslide. The underlying assumption is that elections in the United States are now illegitimate. So why bother engaging with democracy at all if it produces patently “wrong” results?\n      Sign up for Dinner Party\n      A lively evening newsletter about everything that just happened.\n      \n    \n\n  This question lurks behind the MAGA movement’s growing hostility to democracy, not just to Democrats. In his discussions with grassroots Republicans in the election-denial stronghold of Arizona, New York Times reporter Robert Draper found that the old John Birch Society battle cry that America is “a republic, not a democracy” is on many tongues:\n\n  What is different now is the use of “democracy” as a kind of shorthand and even a slur for Democrats themselves, for the left and all the positions espoused by the left, for hordes of would-be but surely unqualified or even illegal voters who are fundamentally anti-American and must be opposed and stopped at all costs. That anti-democracy and anti-“democracy” sentiment, repeatedly voiced over the course of my travels through Arizona, is distinct from anything I have encountered in over two decades of covering conservative politics.\n\n  The identification of conservative political causes as synonymous with Americanism isn’t new, of course. But it’s turning from a rhetorical device to an actual creed whereby the enemies of right-wing political success are deemed enemies to the country itself. This line of reasoning lets MAGA politicians and activists justify any means of resistance, including the often-threatened “Second Amendment remedies.” Kari Lake, Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate, minces no words in hurling anathemas at Democrats and those who collaborate with them, as Draper notes:\n\n  They have cast the 2022 election as not just history-defining but potentially civilization-ending. As Lake told a large crowd in downtown Phoenix the night before the primary: “It is not just a battle between Republicans and Democrats. This is a battle between freedom and tyranny, between authoritarianism and liberty and between good and evil.” A week later, in response to the F.B.I.’s executing a search warrant at Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Lake posted a statement on Twitter: “These tyrants will stop at nothing to silence the Patriots who are working hard to save America.” She added, “America — dark days lie ahead for us.”\n\n  With the very existence of America at stake in every election, does it really matter whether you can prove the “evil” people broke the rules in each individual case? Probably not. And that helps explain why election denial is still flourishing in Arizona. When the state’s bizarre 2020 election audit dragged on for many months and proved nothing that simply led to more assertions that Democrats and RINOs were suppressing the truth. Mark Finchem, the Republican nominee for secretary of State, has summed up the Arizona GOP’s illogic by arguing that the burden of proof should be borne by those who consider legitimate elections legitimate:\n\n\n\n  A former GOP operative told Draper the particular susceptibility of Arizona Republicans to this sort of madness (aside from a tradition of extremism dating back to Barry Goldwater) may be attributable to a huge retiree population prone to conspiracy theories:\n\n  “These are all folks that have traded in their suit pants for sweatpants,” he said. “They’re on the golf course, or they’re in hobby mode. They have more than enough time on their hands. They’re digesting six to 10 hours of Fox News a day. They’re reading on Facebook. They’re meeting with each other to talk about those headlines. And they’re outraged that, ‘Can you believe that the government is lying to us about this?’”\n\n  But there’s clearly something else going on in Arizona and the nation that is deeper than the spread of disinformation. Hostility not just to government but to our democratic system of elections has been growing on the right for quite some time. It was evident during the Supreme Court coup of Bush v. Gore and the contempt Republicans expressed for the 2000 Democratic popular-vote victory. It was more fully manifest in the nasty right-wing reaction to the election of Barack Obama, whose legitimacy as president was regularly challenged and whose social and economic policies were attacked for allegedly redistributing resources from “deserving” taxpayers to undeserving poor people. The feeling on the right that democracy had broken America was expressed perfectly by Obama’s 2012 challenger Mitt Romney in his infamous remarks deploring the ability of the “47 percent” of Americans who owe no net income tax to vote themselves government benefits.\n\n  \n\n\n  The ideological vanguard of the anti-Obama tea-party movement were the politicians and opinion leaders who dubbed themselves “constitutional conservatives,” typified by Jim DeMint, Michele Bachmann, and Ted Cruz. They held that conservative policy prescriptions were embedded in the Founders’ design for America and were eternally binding, regardless of the contrary wishes of democratic majorities. And the absolutism of the constitutional conservative belief system was typically strengthened by Christian nationalist views. An increasing number of conservatives seemed to believe that small government, gun and property rights, and conservative cultural totems like homophobia and fetal rights were handed down by the Founders with the explicit blessing of Jesus Christ. In this scheme, democracy is a strictly circumscribed means for choosing stewards of these inflexible traditions, never to be traduced without dire consequences for the republic.\n\n  Donald Trump and his followers took constitutional conservatism to its next level: an aggressive creed-mixing libertarian hostility to government with reactionary cultural views, all wrapped in the super-patriotic rhetoric of American greatness. Today’s MAGA-dominated GOP is a perfect playground for people like Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel and Blake Masters, the Arizona Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate whose campaign Thiel has bankrolled. Thiel proclaimed in 2009, as the tea-party movement began to rage against Obama’s election, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” A few years earlier, Masters said, “People who support what we euphemistically call ‘democracy’ or ‘representative government’ support stealing certain kinds of goods and redistributing them as they see fit.”\n\n  This authoritarianism in the name of liberty and godliness certainly seems counterintuitive, but it’s extremely useful as a political weapon. Anyone utilizing the democratic process to promote alternative policy visions is deemed un-American, and their successes are dismissed as illegitimate. Or as Trump put it in August 2020: “The only way we’re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.” That could mean fraudulent ballots, or it could mean allowing immigrants who should have never been admitted to America to vote, or it could mean an election controlled by the 47 percent who expect something for nothing. Any democratic process that fails to affirm the righteous views of Trump and his supporters must be “rigged.”\n\n  \n  \n    \n        \n          \n            \n\n          \n          \n            \n              Can Anybody Stop Dan Goldman?\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n\n          \n          \n            \n              The Draw of the Vineyard\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n\n          \n          \n            \n              Rage Against the Machine: Can Alessandra Biaggi Defeat Sean Patrick Maloney?\n            \n          \n        \n    \n      \n      \n        See All\n        \n          \n\n        \n      \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n          \n\n\n\n      For the MAGA Right, Democracy Itself Is a Fraud\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n",

Lindsey Graham testify before a special grand jury that's investigating plots to overturn former President Donald Trump's 2020 presidential election loss in Georgia.A subpoena had instructed the South Carolina Republican to appear before the special grand jury on Tuesday.U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May had denied Graham's request last Monday to quash his subpoena and on Friday rejected his effort to put her decision on hold while he appealed. Graham's lawyers then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.    \n  On Sunday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court issued the order temporarily pausing May's order declining to quash the subpoena. The panel sent the case back to May to decide whether the subpoena should be partially quashed or modified because of protections granted to members of Congress by the U.S. Constitution.Once May decides that issue, the case will return to the 11th Circuit for further consideration, according to the appeals court order.\n\n    \n\nGraham's representatives did not immediately respond Sunday to messages seeking comment on the appellate ruling. A spokesperson for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis declined to comment.Willis opened the investigation early last year, prompted by a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. During that conversation, Trump suggested Raffensperger could \"find\" the votes needed to overturn his narrow loss in the state.Willis and her team have said they want to ask Graham about two phone calls they say he made to Raffensperger and his staff shortly after the 2020 general election. During those calls, Graham asked about \"reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,\" Willis wrote in a petition seeking to compel his testimony.Graham also \"made reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign,\" she wrote.\n\n    \n    \n\nDuring a hearing earlier this month on Graham's motion to quash his subpoena, Willis' team argued that Graham may be able to provide insight into the extent of any coordinated efforts to influence the results of the 2020 general election in Georgia.\n                \n      \n        \n    \n\n    In:\n          United States Congress\n          Georgia\n          United States Senate\n          subpoena\n          Fraud\n          Donald Trump\n          Atlanta\n          Elections\n          lindsey graham\n          Crime\n      \n  \n    Thanks for reading CBS NEWS. \n    Create your free account or log in  for more features.\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Please enter email address to continue\n            \n            \n                Please enter valid email address to continue\n            \n        \n    \n\n  ",

        "content": "\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTom Williams/Getty\n\n\t\t\t\tFight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.After losing reelection in Wyoming this week, Rep. Liz Cheney has set her sights on a new target: keeping “election deniers” out of office, starting with former president Donald Trump.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with ABC’s This Week aired on Sunday morning, Cheney told host Jonathan Karl about her plans to start a political organization tasked with preventing a second Trump presidency and opposing other candidates who support his “Big Lie” about the 2020 election.\n“I’m going to be very focused on working to ensure that we do everything we can not to elect election deniers,” Cheney said. “And I’m going to work against those people. I’m going to work to support their opponents. I think it matters that much.” She told Karl that some of those targets may include her Republican colleagues in Congress.\n\n\nShe also revealed that it would be “very difficult” for her to support a Trump-aligned presidential candidate in 2024. In Cheney’s eyes, Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, both of whom have taken action to overturn the election results, have “made themselves unfit for future office.” And when asked about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another potential challenger to Trump, Cheney said, “DeSantis is somebody who is right now campaigning for election deniers. And I think that is something that people have got to have real pause about. Either you fundamentally believe in and will support our constitutional structure, or you don’t.”\n\n\nElection denial is “dangerous broadly speaking,” Cheney said, and Trump, as the leader of the movement, is the “center of the threat.” After January 6, she said, “There’s just simply no way that the nation can, in my view, sustain itself if we excuse that and put him in a position of power again.” (As my colleague Tim Murphy writes, it should be noted that Cheney endorsed Trump in 2016 and 2020.)\nIn the near future, in her role as vice chair of the House January 6 committee, Cheney plans to use much of her remaining tenure in Congress to educate Americans about the aftermath of the 2020 election. “I think it’s really important for people really across the political spectrum of all ages to understand and recognize why what happened after the last election can never happen again,” she said.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t",

(Johnny Milano/The New York Times)About 8 p.m. on a hot Thursday in July, Nicholas Gubell, a driver for UPS, was nearing the end of his route on Long Island, New York, when he started to feel woozy.That day, Gubell, 26, had delivered about 200 packages. Temperatures had soared into the high 80s, and it was even hotter inside the metal shell of the back of the truck, where, with each stop, he would spend up to a minute or so to retrieve his cargo, sweat beading on his skin.Now, pulled over on the side of the road, he was panting and barely able to speak, gripping his phone with his hand, which had cramped from dehydration.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times“My body was losing it,” Gubell said. Paramedics covered him in ice packs to bring down his body temperature and took him to a hospital. “I was just trying to hold on as best I could.”As blistering heat waves swept across the United States this summer, breaking temperature records and placing millions under heat advisories and warnings, workers such as Gubell have continued to deliver America’s packages for a variety of carriers, often in trucks that have no cooling mechanisms for drivers. Some UPS workers have shared photographs that show thermometer readings of up to 150 degrees in the backs of their trucks.Now a string of heat-related illnesses among the drivers has renewed calls to improve their working conditions.“They’re vomiting. Their bodies are shutting down,” said Dave Reeves, president of Local 767, a Texas local of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 350,000 UPS workers across the country. “It’s awful.”Government records show that the problem is not isolated: Since 2015, at least 270 UPS and U.S. Postal Service drivers have been sickened and in many cases hospitalized from heat exposure. Dozens of workers for other delivery companies, including FedEx, have also suffered from heat exhaustion, according to the records, and a handful of drivers have also died in the past few years. According to the Teamsters, heat-related injuries, illnesses and deaths among drivers are severely underreported.The issue first drew widespread public attention in 2019, after reporting by the Center for Public Integrity and NBC News highlighted the grave heat dangers faced by mail and delivery workers.The Teamsters have been mobilizing for better protection for UPS workers in anticipation of contract negotiations next year. “With the temperatures and the record heat waves, it’s getting to the point where we are getting an alarming amount of heat-related injuries,” Reeves said.In just the past six weeks, he added, 18 of about 9,500 workers in his jurisdiction had become sickened by heat. “It’s absolutely getting worse,” he said.Although tying a particular heat wave to climate change requires analysis, scientists have no doubt that heat waves around the world are becoming hotter, more frequent and longer-lasting.In the United States, the number of hot days is increasing, according to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, a major scientific report by 13 federal agencies, which found that the frequency of heat waves jumped from an average of two per year in the 1960s to six per year by the 2010s. The season for heat waves is now 45 days longer than it was in the 1960s, according to the report.Last year, Jose Cruz Rodriguez Jr., a 23-year-old UPS driver in Reeves’ local, was found dead in the company’s parking lot in Waco, Texas, just days after starting the job. In June, a 24-year-old UPS driver, Esteban David Chavez Jr., died while delivering packages in Pasadena, California, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Last month, another of the company’s workers was captured in footage from a Ring doorbell, stumbling and collapsing outside a home in Scottsdale, Arizona.Although Postal Service and other delivery drivers have also been sickened, attention has mostly been focused on UPS, which is the world’s largest package delivery company and among the biggest employers in the nation. Although its tractor-trailers are cooled, the company’s smaller delivery trucks do not have air conditioning.“Our package delivery vehicles make frequent stops, which requires the engine to be turned off and the doors to be opened and closed, about 130 times a day on average,” the company said in a statement.“The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority,” UPS said, adding that in preparation for heat waves, it was providing workers with additional water, ice, electrolyte replacement beverages and fruit.The company said it also planned to distribute cooling towels and uniforms made of moisture-wicking fabric and to accelerate the installation of fans in vehicles across the country. “We never want our employees to continue working to the point that they risk their health or work in an unsafe manner,” the company added.At the same time, lawmakers have also been pushing for better conditions for mail carriers.Last month, U.S. Rep. Tony Cárdenas, D-Calif., introduced a bill that would require the Postal Service to install air conditioning in all of its vehicles. The measure is named after a 63-year-old driver for the service, Peggy Frank, who, on a 117-degree day in 2018, was found unresponsive in her mail truck in the San Fernando Valley, about 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.Currently, 34% of its vehicles have air conditioning and an additional 66% have fans, the Postal Service said, adding that any vehicles purchased after 2003 were equipped with air conditioning.“Our carriers deliver the mail throughout the year during varying temperatures and climatic conditions,” the Postal Service said in a statement. “This includes during the summer months when the temperatures rise throughout the country.”The Postal Service reminds carriers to stay hydrated, wear hats and get in the shade whenever possible, it said, and noted that it started a heat illness prevention program to provide mail carriers with training and “resources needed to do their jobs safely.”UPS has also trained employees to “work safely throughout the year,” it said, and added it has sent reminders during the day to “stay hydrated and to take their rest breaks.”Drivers said such reminders were insulting in the context of their strenuous working conditions. It is difficult to drink enough water in an environment where bathroom breaks are limited to stopping at stores and restaurants, UPS workers said, adding that their requests for fans had often gone unmet.“You can drink gallons of water, but it still gets to you,” Matt Leichenger, 26, a Brooklyn UPS driver and shop steward, said of the heat. The training, he added, “basically tells you to drink water and eat cucumbers and watermelons.”As temperatures have risen in the past few years, so too have the demands for shipping. The coronavirus pandemic kept shoppers at home, causing a surge in e-commerce and, drivers say, more stops on their routes.“There’s only so much a body can handle,” said Tony Bell, a UPS driver in Longview, Texas. Bell, 45, was hospitalized for heat exposure and renal failure after working his route on a 103-degree day in July.That day, he drank 12 bottles of water and a Gatorade. He said doctors later told him that he had come extremely close to a heart attack. “I was scared that was it,” he said.Jorja Rodriguez, mother of Jose Cruz Rodriguez, the UPS driver who died after his shift in Texas last August, said she had sent her son to work that morning with a cooler full of water and energy drinks and told him to “take it easy.”When he did not come home that night, she drove to UPS and watched as the police found her son, dead.“I called his name so many times, thinking that if he would hear my voice, he would wake up,” she said, adding that he had texted his supervisor earlier that day to say that he was not feeling well. Dominique Chavez, stepmother of Esteban David Chavez, who died in Pasadena, said that since his death, she and her family had made a point of flagging down UPS workers to offer them a tip and a drink of cold water.Gubell, the Long Island worker, said he felt fortunate that on the day he felt ill, he had managed to call his parents.He was too incoherent to give them his location, but they called 911. A neighbor also alerted authorities. “I didn’t want to call the ambulance,” Gubell said, adding that he feared that if he had done so, he would face retaliation from UPS.“People are dropping like flies out here,” he added. “It’s very brutal.”In an email, UPS said that if one of their drivers required immediate assistance, the company would send personnel to their location to help them safely return to the delivery center or arrange for immediate assistance at the driver’s location, which could include calling an ambulance.Gubell’s mother, Prudence, said she regretted having encouraged her son to apply for the job with UPS and never imagined that a neighborhood job delivering packages could be so perilous.“I worry about him,” Gubell said. “How much can the human body take?”© 2022 The New York Times CompanyMore Money for IRS Spurs Conspiracy Theories of 'Shadow Army'WASHINGTON — It has been called President Joe Biden’s “shadow army,” described as a strike force to shake down small businesses with assault rifles and likened to a militia of auditors on search-and-destroy missions.

        "content": "Photo: Laura Cavanaugh/Getty ImagesFormer basketball player Dennis Rodman told NBC News Saturday he's planning a visit to Russia to help secure the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who's been detained in the country since February.The big picture: Rodman, who has a relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has a history of conducting informal diplomacy on the U.S.'s behalf during multiple trips to North Korea.The former NBA player credited himself for helping get the release of American Kenneth Bae from North Korea because he wrote a 2014 letter to Kim, and he was with former President Donald Trump during a 2018 meeting with the North Korean leader.What he's saying: \"I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,\" Rodman told NBC News. \"I'm trying to go this week.\"Rodman doesn't need U.S. permission to go to Russia, but the U.S. State Department has advised Americans from entering the country.Rodman isn't as close with Russian President Vladimir Putin as he is with Kim, NBC News notes, but he called the leader  \"cool\" after a 2014 trip to Moscow.\"I know Putin too well,\" he told NBC News.Background: Griner was found guilty on drug charges by a Russian court and sentenced to nine years in prison earlier this month, months after Russian authorities said they found a vape cartridge with hashish oil in her luggage.U.S. officials have maintained Griner was wrongfully detained by Russia.Go deeperFadel AllassanRep. Dan Crenshaw: Trump Mar-a-Lago search \"hard to justify\"Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) told CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that the FBI search of former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence was \"hard to justify\" for Republicans because of its unprecedented nature.Why it matters: Trump and Republicans have broadly painted the search as an example of government overreach, and some have moved to portray it as President Biden trying to damage his potential 2024 opponent.Go deeper (1 min. read)",

        "title": "Elon Musk says Tesla will hike the price of FSD driver assistance software by 25% in September",
        "content": "Tesla founder Elon Musk was practically apologetic on his company's earnings call for hiking prices to meet higher costs.Sean Zanni | Patrick Mcmullan | Getty ImagesTesla CEO Elon Musk on Sunday announced a 25% price increase for the company's premium driver assistance system, which is marketed under the name Full Self-Driving, or FSD. The price will increase to $15,000 from $12,000 on Sept. 5, Musk said in a tweet.Today, Tesla charges customers $12,000 upfront for FSD, or $199 per month on a subscription basis.Musk did not immediately mention an increase in the cost of FSD subscriptions and Tesla did not respond to a request for further information.All new Tesla vehicles come with a standard driver assistance package called Autopilot, which includes features like \"Traffic-Aware Cruise Control\" and \"Autosteer.\" These rely on cameras, other sensors, hardware and software to automatically keep a Tesla vehicle centered in its lane and traveling at the speed of surrounding traffic.Tesla's highest-priced driver assistance option, FSD, includes what the company calls \"Traffic and Stop Sign Control\" and \"Navigate on Autopilot\" among its features.These more advanced features are intended to let Tesla cars automatically detect and slow down for traffic signs and signals; navigate from highway on-ramp to off-ramp while engaging turn signals; make lane changes and take exits.Tesla tells drivers to remain attentive and be prepared to take over their cars' steering and braking at any time while using Autopilot or FSD. Its technology does not make Tesla vehicles autonomous.One Tesla feature called Smart Summon allows drivers to use a smartphone and Tesla mobile app like a remote control to call their car from across a parking lot and slowly drive, without anyone behind the wheel, to where they are standing.While some FSD features are also included in a lower-priced option called Enhanced Autopilot, or EAP, only Tesla customers who buy or subscribe to the premium option can request access to FSD Beta, an experimental version of Tesla's system.FSD Beta users are supposed to obtain a high \"Safety Score\" from Tesla to get and maintain access to the system.Tesla's approach has drawn criticism and regulatory scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the California Department of Motor Vehicles alike.Still, the company is forging ahead and doing a limited release of the latest version of FSD Beta, to a relatively small pool of users, Musk also tweeted on Sunday.Earlier, he wrote on Twitter, \"There are many major code changes, so this will be an extra cautious rollout. Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners, then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback & release to ~10k customers, then 10.69.2 week after & release to rest of FSD Beta.\"Owners who gain access to FSD Beta are able to send feedback to the company via their cars when the system fails or acts glitchy. Tesla previously said 100,000 drivers had already installed FSD Beta.Tesla is planning to make FSD Beta even more mainstream.At the Tesla 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting on August 4, Musk said that FSD Beta will be available to anyone who requests it by the end of this year. Here's a quote from Thomson Financial's transcript of the meeting: \"We're still tracking very much to have widespread deployment of FSD Beta this year in North America. So I should say basically, FSD will be available to anyone who requests it by the end of this year.\"Among those who are receiving the limited-release update this weekend are widely followed social media influencers who sell Tesla merchandise and run ad-supported videos on YouTube channels where they review Tesla's latest releases and more.Since 2016, the NHTSA has opened 38 probes into collisions that involved a Tesla vehicle where driver assistance systems including Autopilot and more advanced systems were thought to be a factor. Nineteen fatalities were reported as part of those Tesla-involved collisions under investigation.Separately, California's DMV recently accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices with regard to the features in its vehicles, and it is conducting a technical review of Tesla's systems including FSD Beta.Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's director of Autopilot software, said on Twitter this weekend that \"Autopilot prevents ~40 crashes /day where human drivers mistakenly press the accelerator at 100% instead of the brakes.\" Tesla generally does not make data about its systems available to third-party researchers for confirmation of its claims.",

        "date": 1661114892678,
        "title": "Polio in U.S., UK, and Israel Reveals Rare Risk of Oral Vaccine",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\tLONDON (AP) – For years, global health officials have used billions of drops of an oral vaccine in a remarkably effective campaign aimed at wiping out polio in its last remaining strongholds – typically, poor, politically unstable corners of the world.\nNow, in a surprising twist in the decades-long effort to eradicate the virus, authorities in Jerusalem, New York and London have discovered evidence that polio is spreading there.\n\n\nThe original source of the virus? The oral vaccine itself.\nScientists have long known about this extremely rare phenomenon. That is why some countries have switched to other polio vaccines. But these incidental infections from the oral formula are becoming more glaring as the world inches closer to eradication of the disease and the number of polio cases caused by the wild, or naturally circulating, virus plummets.\nSince 2017, there have been 396 cases of polio caused by the wild virus, versus more than 2,600 linked to the oral vaccine, according to figures from the World Health Organization and its partners.\n\n“We are basically replacing the wild virus with the virus in the vaccine, which is now leading to new outbreaks,” said Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor who has studied polio eradication. “I would assume that countries like the U.K. and the U.S. will be able to stop transmission quite quickly, but we also thought that about monkeypox.”\nThe latest incidents represent the first time in several years that vaccine-connected polio virus has turned up in rich countries.\nEarlier this year, officials in Israel detected polio in an unvaccinated 3-year-old, who suffered paralysis. Several other children, nearly all of them unvaccinated, were found to have the virus but no symptoms.\nIn June, British authorities reported finding evidence in sewage that the virus was spreading, though no infections in people were identified. Last week, the government said all children in London ages 1 to 9 would be offered a booster shot.\nIn the U.S., an unvaccinated young adult suffered paralysis in his legs after being infected with polio, New York officials revealed last month. The virus has also shown up in New York sewers, suggesting it is spreading. But officials said they are not planning a booster campaign because they believe the state’s high vaccination rate should offer enough protection.\n\nGenetic analyses showed that the viruses in the three countries were all “vaccine-derived,” meaning that they were mutated versions of a virus that originated in the oral vaccine.\nThe oral vaccine at issue has been used since 1988 because it is cheap, easy to administer – two drops are put directly into children’s mouths – and better at protecting entire populations where polio is spreading. It contains a weakened form of the live virus.\n\nBut it can also cause polio in about two to four children per 2 million doses. (Four doses are required to be fully immunized.) In extremely rare cases, the weakened virus can also sometimes mutate into a more dangerous form and spark outbreaks, especially in places with poor sanitation and low vaccination levels.\nThese outbreaks typically begin when people who are vaccinated shed live virus from the vaccine in their faeces. From there, the virus can spread within the community and, over time, turn into a form that can paralyze people and start new epidemics.\nMany countries that eliminated polio switched to injectable vaccines containing a killed virus decades ago to avoid such risks; the Nordic countries and the Netherlands never used the oral vaccine. The ultimate goal is to move the entire world to the shots once wild polio is eradicated, but some scientists argue that the switch should happen sooner.\n\n“We probably could never have gotten on top of polio in the developing world without the (oral polio vaccine), but this is the price we’re now paying,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The only way we are going to eliminate polio is to eliminate the use of the oral vaccine.”\nAidan O’Leary, director of WHO’s polio department, described the discovery of polio spreading in London and New York as “a major surprise,” saying that officials have been focused on eradicating the disease in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where health workers have been killed for immunizing children and where conflict has made access to some areas impossible.\nStill, O’Leary said he is confident Israel, Britain and the U.S. will shut down their newly identified outbreaks quickly.\nThe oral vaccine is credited with dramatically reducing the number of children paralyzed by polio. When the global eradication effort began in 1988, there were about 350,000 cases of wild polio a year. So far this year, there have been 19 cases of wild polio, all in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Mozambique.\n\nIn 2020, the number of polio cases linked to the vaccine hit a peak of more than 1,100 spread out across dozens of countries. It has since declined to around 200 this year so far.\nLast year, WHO and partners also began using a newer oral polio vaccine, which contains a live but weakened virus that scientists believe is less likely to mutate into a dangerous form. But supplies are limited.\nTo stop polio in Britain, the U.S. and Israel, what is needed is more vaccination, experts say. That is something Columbia University’s Barrett worries could be challenging in the COVID-19 era.\n“What’s different now is a reduction in trust of authorities and the political polarization in countries like the U.S. and the UK,” Barrett said. “The presumption that we can quickly get vaccination numbers up quickly may be more challenging now.”\nOyewale Tomori, a virologist who helped direct Nigeria’s effort to eliminate polio, said that in the past, he and colleagues baulked at describing outbreaks as “vaccine-derived,” wary it would make people fearful of the vaccine.\n“All we can do is explain how the vaccine works and hope that people understand that immunization is the best protection, but it’s complicated,” Tomori said. “In hindsight, maybe it would have been better not to use this vaccine, but at that time, nobody knew it would turn out like this.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

        "title": "Ukrainian Troops Destroy Three Russian Military Recon Drones In An Hour",
        "content": "\nRecently, Ukrainian troops destroyed three drones in use for reconnaissance purposes by Russian military forces in the Kherson region of Ukraine, according to newly available info — and Ukrainian personnel did so within the span of just an hour.\n\n“Between 12:00 and 13:00 on 21 August, soldiers from the Air Force Command Pivden (South) detected and brought down three operational-tactical unmanned aerial vehicles in the sky over Kherson Oblast,” the portion of Ukraine’s military responsible for the operation said in an update. The destroyed aircraft — Orlan-10 UAVs (UAV stands for unmanned aerial vehicle) — were evidently meant for providing information used in the adjustment of artillery fire, according to the same Ukrainian military source, which also recently revealed the destruction of another pair of Russian ammo storage facilities. Such strikes significantly impact the ability of Putin’s aggressors to wage war.\nThe destroyed Russian ammo storage sites were in Chornobaivka and Starytsi, which are in the Kherson region. Chornobaivka has seen frequent Ukrainian strikes on Russian military personnel and assets located there throughout the unfolding war. Journalist Emma Burrows reported just the other day that a Western official said it seemed the Russians were running low on ammunition. “We have a large range of evidence to suggest munitions are being depleted… [including] munitions coming out of deep storage,” that official said, per Burrows’s reporting. Strikes on ammo depots could certainly accelerate that trend. “Ukrainian rocket-artillery units struck the command post of the 247th Air Assault Rifle Regiment of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division,” a Ukrainska Pravda report adds in summary of operations on August 20.\nThe U.S. is continuing to provide significant support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. On August 8, the Defense Department announced another $1 billion in various assets for Ukrainian defenders, ranging from munitions for the HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems put into use inside the country to armored medical vehicles. Also included in the huge cache of support were 20 mortar systems and 20,000 rounds for those systems, alongside surface-to-air missiles, explosives such as C-4, and more. The August 8 announcement constituted the single largest drawdown of Defense Department assets in support of Ukraine thus far, and it was the eighteenth drawdown by the Biden administration for Ukraine since August of 2021. “To meet Ukraine’s evolving battlefield requirements, the United States will continue to work with its Allies and partners to provide Ukraine with key capabilities calibrated to make a difference,” Defense Department spokesperson Todd Breasseale said alongside the announcement of that U.S. support.\n\n\n\n",

Cheney pledged to help Democrats during an appearance on ABC's \"This Week.\"\"We've got election deniers that have been nominated for really important positions all across the country,\" Cheney said on Sunday morning.\"I'm going to be very focused on working to ensure that we do everything we can, not to elect election deniers,\" Cheney declared. \"I'm going to work against those people, I’m going to work to support their opponents. I think it matters that much.\" Cheney promised to get involved in campaigns to oust any Republicans who challenge or deny the results of the 2020 presidential election. Among those Republicans who Cheney would not support is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – who is a top GOP presidential candidate for 2024 along with former President Donald Trump. \"I think that DeSantis is somebody who is, right now, campaigning for election deniers,\" she said, according to USA Today. \"And I think that, you know, that is something that I think people have got to have real pause about. You know, either you fundamentally believe in and will support our constitutional structure, or you don't.\"\n\n  Despite Cheney suffering a humiliating loss to Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman in last week's Wyoming Republican primary, \"This Week\" host Jonathan Karl asked Cheney about her presidential aspirations and if she would even run as a Republican. \"I haven't made any specific decisions or plans about that at this point,\" she said, and would not reveal if she would run as an independent or not. \"Look, you run for president because you believe you would be the best – the best candidate, because you believe you'd be the best president of the United States,\" Cheney stated. \"And so, any decision that I make about doing something that significant and that serious would be with the intention of winning and because I think I would be the best candidate.\"The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney claimed that the Republican National Committee and Trump would fear her as a presidential candidate. \"I can understand why they would not want me on a debate stage with Donald Trump,\" she said. \"I can understand why they wouldn't want it, and I would imagine Donald Trump isn't too interested in that either.\"A Morning Consult poll from earlier this month for the Republican presidential candidate in 2024 had Trump as the frontrunner with 56% of the vote. Cheney garnered a mere 2% support. Cheney said she plans to \"educate\" Americans about the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'm also going to spend a lot of time doing everything I can to help educate the American people about what happened. And I think our hearings have been a tremendous contribution to that,\" Cheney said. \n        \n                \n        \\u201cAfter her primary defeat, GOP Rep.

        "title": "A Disunited Left Clears the Field for a Moderate in NY 10",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nA Disunited Left Clears the Field for a Moderate in NY 10A Disunited Left Clears the Field for a Moderate in NY 10A congressional primary spanning swaths of Manhattan and Brooklyn proves that you can have too many progressive candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 19, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The open Democratic primary for New York’s new 10th Congressional District has been as wild and bitter as anticipated, a pile-up of at least six prominent contenders who are desperately vying to represent some of the most prestigious turf in America. The outcome could be a gut punch for progressives, who are currently on the outside looking in as a multimillionaire ex-prosecutor leads the field with only days to go until the August 23 primary. \nAs is true for most House contests with no viable Republican opposition, the national stakes of the race are somewhat limited. But whoever wins will inevitably become one of the more prominent members of Congress in America, representing wealthy and storied neighborhoods like Brooklyn Heights, Tribeca, Greenwich Village, and Park Slope. New York City Hall sits in the 10th, and many celebrities and millionaire donors are constituents. Dan Goldman, the lawyer who worked on the first impeachment of Donald Trump, has invested several million of his own dollars into the race and far outspent the field, positioning himself as a tough-on-crime moderate who can appeal to national liberals through his work opposing Trump. As a master troll move, Trump endorsed Goldman earlier this week, and his opponents were happy to lash Goldman at the final televised debate over his alleged closeness to the former president. Goldman, a frequent cable TV guest who gets plenty of free coverage that way, has strong anti-Trump bona fides, however, and there’s a reason he is still the polling leader.\nCan Goldman be stopped? That’s the operating question for the other five Democrats, especially Mondaire Jones, a sitting congressman, and Yuh-Line Niou, the Working Families Party-backed Manhattan assemblywoman popular with online progressives. Goldman, an heir to the Levi-Strauss fortune, is worth as much as $250 million; Jones and Niou teamed up at a press conference to accuse of him trying to buy the House seat and subvert democracy. It can be argued that he’s doing that—he’s also raised hefty amounts of cash from Wall Street and the real estate industry—but this is a district with lots of wealthy white liberals who are nostalgic for the technocratic paternalism of Michael Bloomberg. Since the billionaire Bloomberg spent far more to get elected three times as mayor, it’s not clear that voters will be moved by this argument. Goldman’s securing the New York Times endorsement—a controversial decision—only makes it harder for his rivals to accuse him of being a shadow conservative.\nWhat is clear is that all the candidates are focused on Goldman, which could damage him in the home stretch. Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan city councilor who has won the endorsements of Nydia Velázquez and 1199SEIU—the health care workers union and the state’s largest union—recently mocked Goldman for flip-flopping on abortion. Rivera has polled near the top of the field. Unlike Jones and Niou, Rivera has attempted to bridge the divide between more progressive and moderate voters, hoovering up donations from the real estate industry and taking pro-development stances.\t\nWhat there won’t be is any easy consolidation among progressives or left-leaning candidates against Goldman. Niou has polled highest and represents overlapping territory with Rivera’s, but the candidates are close enough in the race that neither has an incentive to leave this late in the game. There’s no ranked-choice voting, making these alliances all the harder to pull off. The biggest loser of the race may be Jones, a popular congressman who moved from Rockland County to Brooklyn after his district was redrawn and he was faced with running against Sean Patrick Maloney, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Jones has spent millions on television and digital ads but never led the field. Time may be running out for him. Voters could be punishing him for his lack of roots in the district. Despite his strong ties to national progressives, Jones failed to win significant local endorsements, losing out on the WFP to Niou, the Times to Goldman, and Velázquez to Rivera. Unlike former mayor Bill de Blasio, who dropped out of the race in July, Jones long believed he had a path to victory. We will soon find out if that was true.\nThe biggest question hanging over the race, perhaps, is turnout. Because of redistricting chaos that took place earlier in the year, the August primary date will only feature House and state Senate contests. Many well-heeled New Yorkers are out of town altogether. The progressives are hoping Goldman’s base is too busy in the Hamptons or Vermont to care about a Democratic primary. They may be right—or perhaps Goldman will spend just enough to win. These final days, for the Brooklynites and Manhattanites who care, will be fraught with intrigue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Policy\n\n",

        "date": 1661114990027,
        "title": "The rise of monkeypox",
        "content": "Once rarely seen outside of Africa, the disease is spreading across the U.S. and around the world. Here's everything you need to know: What is monkeypox?First identified by Danish scientists in 1958, monkeypox is caused by a virus that's a milder cousin of smallpox. It was discovered in laboratory monkeys, but its primary vectors are thought to be rodents. The first known human case surfaced in a 9-month-old boy in Congo in 1970. Since then, most cases have been limited to West and Central Africa, where people catch it by coming into close contact with infected animals. Limited cases traceable to African animals have occurred elsewhere, including the U.S., where in 2003 about 70 cases were reported among people who got it from pet prairie dogs who'd been housed with African animals. But the current outbreak is unprecedented. Why have there been so many cases?The disease is now spreading from human to human, overwhelmingly through men having sex with other men. Since the first cases surfaced in May, the spread has been rapid. About 35,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide, and 12,689 in the U.S. as of Aug. 16, according to the Centers for Disease Control — a 34 percent increase from a week earlier. Those numbers are thought to be a fraction of the true case counts. The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global emergency on July 23; the U.S. designated it a national health emergency two weeks later. How does it affect people?Those infected typically develop a flu-like illness, with symptoms including fever, head and muscle aches, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. That's followed by a painful rash that develops into fluid-containing pustules that scab over. Symptoms generally appear six to 13 days after exposure, though it can take as long as three weeks. Patients are infectious from when symptoms start to when the scabs fall off (sometimes leaving scars). There have been no fatalities in the U.S., and patients typically recover on their own. But the pain and discomfort can be debilitating; one study found it led to hospitalization in 10 percent of patients. \"It was like someone taking a hole puncher all over my body,\" said Kevin Kwong, a California man hospitalized with over 600 lesions.Why is it spreading now?Virologists think monkeypox may have undergone small mutations that have enabled it to pass readily from person to person. It spreads primarily through intimate, skin-to-skin contact, and possibly through genital fluids, with 98 percent of cases affecting gay or bisexual men, according to a recent study. In theory, it may also spread through respiratory droplets from a cough or sneeze or through bedding or towels shared with an infected person — but scientists are quick to note that it's not nearly as infectious as Covid, which spreads easily through the air. \"What we're not seeing is casual spread,\" said Jay Gladstein, an infectious-disease specialist in Los Angeles. \"It's got to be really close contact.\" What's been the response?Scientists say federal health officials were too slow to react when the first cases surfaced outside Africa in early May. Community spread \"should have rung alarm bells,\" said Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health. That was when officials should have begun ramping up testing capacity and stockpiling vaccines. Instead, early testing was limited and results had to be sent to the CDC for confirmation; it wasn't until late June that the government expanded capacity by sending tests to commercial labs. The government holds a large stockpile of an effective vaccine — Jynneos, which was formulated for smallpox — but was slow to release doses and to order more. While millions of doses are now on order, men in some cities are lining up for a very inadequate number of shots, and the FDA has authorized doctors to split up doses to extend them. Critics say contact tracing has been inadequate, and so has outreach to doctors, who may not realize their patients have monkeypox. The critics also say public health messaging has failed to clearly warn gay and bisexual men that they are by far at the highest risk of being infected. [See box.] Can it be contained?That remains to be seen, but many experts say it's too late to reverse the outbreak. Monkeypox is destined to become \"entrenched\" in the population, they believe, and while it won't spread as widely as Covid has, it may make inroads into the general population. At least five children and one pregnant woman in the U.S. have been infected, through contact with infected men. One concern is that the virus could take root among domestic animals, which could spread it back to humans. Improved contact tracing, better outreach campaigns, and expanded funding of sexual health clinics can all help combat the virus, but experts say an aggressive, large-scale response is needed now. \"There is an imminent window of time by which we can get ahead\" of the spread, said Tyler TerMeer of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. \"And that window continues to close.\"The shadow of AIDSShould monkeypox be spoken of as primarily a sexually transmitted disease? That's become a thorny subject, and has sparked debate over how awareness efforts should be targeted. Technically, anyone who has skin-to-skin contact with an infected person could get monkey­pox. Some health officials believe it's important to stress that point and not label monkey­pox a \"gay disease.\" People might think, \"I'm not a gay man, so I'm good no matter what,\" said Stella Safo, founder of Just Equity for Health. But others say public health officials afraid of stigmatizing gay men have been too timid about emphasizing that they're almost exclusively the ones getting infected. \"Pretending that that's not the case doesn't help any of us,\" said Will Nutland, founder of two British health groups for gay and bisexual men. Looming over the conversation is the legacy of the early years of AIDS, when talk of a \"gay plague\" brought a stigma that still resonates. How to speak about — and effectively ­combat — this new disease is \"a fine line that many people are walking right now,\" said Perry Halkitis of the Rutgers School of Public Health.This article was first published in the latest issue of The Week magazine.

        "content": "\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 37 people have gotten sick in an E. coli outbreak in the Midwest, and the CDC is investigating if romaine lettuce served by Wendy's restaurants is the cause.It's likely the true size of the outbreak is larger; people generally recover from E. coli without medical care and aren't tested. But ten of the confirmed cases have required hospitalization, and the bacteria can cause a type of kidney failure.The CDC said it's still investigating the cause of the outbreak, but as of Aug. 19., 22 people said they had eaten at Wendy's locations in Michigan, Ohio, or Pennsylvania in the week before they became sick. Of those people, many said they'd eaten a burger or sandwich with romaine lettuce, and Wendy's has removed romaine from its menus in that region as a precaution, the CDC said.The people in the outbreak range in age from 6 to 91 years old, but most were young adults with a median age of 21.The CDC isn't recommending that people stop eating at Wendy's or avoid eating lettuce more broadly at this time. The fast food chain uses a different type of lettuce for its salads. There's also no evidence yet that romaine served by other restaurants or sold at grocery stores is contaminated, the CDC said, but it's continuing to investigate if any other chains use the same source of romaine as Wendy's in the Midwest.E. coli causes severe stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. People should call their doctor if they have diarrhea for more than 3 days without improvement, if it's bloody, or if they also have a fever of more than 102 degrees. They should also seek medical attention if they're vomiting so much they're unable to keep liquids down or if they're showing signs of dehydration.An E. coli outbreak involving romaine lettuce swept across the US in 2018, and more than 200 people got sick. Five of them died.\n\n",

        "content": "\nWhether they’re yelling at normal people for eating a burger, smearing menstrual blood on themselves to protest a ham sandwich, vegans are always thinking up new ways to make meaty asses of themselves.\n\n\nSometimes, it ends very badly – like being run over by a truck, getting clocked for invading a pizza joint, or getting the broccoli beaten out of them for invading a rabbit farm. The spectacle is what they are after. Stopping Joe Average from chowing down on a double pepperoni pizza is secondary to the “look-at-me” moment. What they are not doing is changing hearts and minds.\nIn fact, there is little chance that screaming silly slogans and interfering with businesses will motivate anyone to drop their meatball hoagie for an order of kale. I don’t know about you, but I have never considered eating just fruits, vegetables, and nuts for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. When I see vegans cuss-out meat-eaters, it does inspire me. I make sure that I have a juicy burger or steak for my next meal. Of course, I will toss on a slice of tomato with my burger, and add a side of veggies with the steak – but just the vegetables? Nah\nSomeone bellowing, “Animals want to live. Animals feel pain” and “It’s not food. It’s violence” isn’t going to stop me from craving and consuming some delicious meat. As I said, it’s really not about changing minds. It’s about the spectacle. Like children, vegans want their veggies raw and their attention rawer.\nOn Saturday, a bunch of vegan activists in Nashville decided that a Starbucks upcharge for almond milk was a crime. Oat/almond milk costs more than milk from a cow. Vegans are angry–super angry–and they are not going to take it anymore.\nA bunch of them decided that the only way to get their way at Starbucks was to encase themselves in concrete. As stupid as that sounds, the visual is even funnier. The grass-eaters placed themselves in front of the entrances as roadblocks. I guess it prevented coffee drinkers from getting their caffeine fix. Eight cop cars were needed to cordon off the crime scene.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t get it. Either pick them up with forklifts and drop them into a pond, or just push them over like an urban cow-tip. The irony.\nThere’s also a high probability that these Nashville vegans are unaware of wet cement chemistry. I hope they collectively neglected to consider what elements make up blocks of concrete before they become blocks. Lime and portland cement kinda burns.\nMaybe all of them are crying now in their mom’s basement. I hope it started as an itch and built into “make it stop!” pain, while they begged the cops to extricate them from their “cement overshoes.” I know it sounds mean, but I hope they exposed raw flesh to wet cement and their little piggies were bathing in wet cement before the slabs were hard as stone.\nIs it mean to hope that the end result was, at a minimum, citations, and feet that look like… hamburger? Oh, the irony.\n\n",

        "content": "Investigators work at the site of a suspected car bomb attack that killed Darya Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin, in the Moscow region, Russia, August 21, 2022. (Investigative Committee of Russia/Handout via Reuters)All Our Opinion in Your InboxNR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon. No charge.\nCNN:\nDarya Dugina, the daughter of influential Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, was reportedly killed on Saturday when the car she was traveling in exploded in the Moscow region, the Russian state news agency TASS has reported.\n\nAndrei Krasnov, head of the Russky Gorizont (Russian Horizon) social movement and a personal acquaintance of the woman’s family, told TASS on Sunday that Dugina had been killed when her car caught fire following an explosion . . .\nImages from the aftermath of the explosion began circulating on Russian social media Saturday, appearing to show a vehicle on fire at the side of the road and smashed car parts strewn across the surrounding area. CNN is not able to independently verify the images.\nKrasnov told TASS he knew Dugina personally and that the car she was traveling in belonged to her father. He believed Alexander was the true target of the blast, or possibly both of them.\n“It’s her father’s car,” Krasnov told TASS. “Dasha (Darya) drives another car, but she drove his car today, and Alexander went separately.”\nThe senior Dugin is a far-right Russian author and ideologue, credited with being the architect or “spiritual guide” to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He is purported to have significant influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin and is frequently described as “Putin’s Brain.” . . .\nIn March 2022, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Dugina for her contribution to an article on the United World International (UWI) website suggesting that Ukraine would “perish” if it is admitted to NATO. Dugina was UWI’s chief editor.\nAlthough Dugina appeared to have shared many of her father’s views, it seems unlikely (if this was indeed a deliberate killing) that she would have been considered important enough to have been a target in her own right. As for whether Dugin can be described in any sense as “Putin’s brain,” I am in no position to know, but I doubt it, although he has had his uses.\n\n\nOver time, Putin has developed a relatively coherent ideology — authoritarianism, pseudo-traditionalism, and aggressive nationalism both at home and abroad — which is rooted in a logic of sorts, however distasteful. By contrast, Dugin, who has been a very vocal supporter of the war in Ukraine, is a “philosopher” not known for his grasp of logic. He has spent years promoting and updating Eurasianism, a misty concoction first dreamt up, at least in something approaching its modern form, by Lev Gumilev, both inside the Gulag (he was the son of Anna Akhmatova, Russia’s greatest 20th century poet, no friend of the Soviet regime) and, later, outside it.\nA good starting point for understanding Eurasianism is Black Wind, White Snow by Charles Clover (a former Moscow bureau chief for the Financial Times), which I reviewed for the Weekly Standard in 2016. In the course of the review, I wrote:\nMuch of modern Eurasianism is based on little more than the imagination of Lev Gumilev: “He invented people, he invented documents, or transported things magically through time so that they would fit his narrative” of a “super-ethnos,” no less, formed by the fusion of cultures between Russians and a series of surprising pals—the Mongols and other unlikely folk—from the steppe. With Gumilev as its leading, somewhat unhinged, spokesman, Eurasianism spread as a nationalist alternative or (within the ranks of the regime) supplement to the exhausted Marxism-Leninism of the Brezhnev years, a period in which ideological discourse was more complicated than the usual image of a Soviet monolith would suggest . . .\nEurasianism has proved to be a most useful ideology [in the more recent Putin years], a tool for Kremlin authoritarianism and a channel for mischief-making with the Western hard right. And its belligerent view of international politics, combining reconquest of the “near abroad” with paranoia about the eternal Atlantic adversary, makes for martial mood music, handy for drowning out domestic dissent . . .\nSo, what now?\n\n\n\nWhether or not Ukrainian forces (or, for that matter, opponents of the war) were responsible for Dugina’s death, it is reasonable to assume the former will be blamed by the Kremlin, with consequences that will surely include some form of retaliation.\nBack to The Corner",

That’s a good idea, isn’t it? No, the meaning becomes clear once you understand it.\n\nThe keyword is here is data. Data is supposed to be the new oil in this new technological era. Our phones and Fitbits are used to collect data about our locations, spending patterns, educational and economic status, political allegiances, walking steps, and oxygen levels.\nBut through the Internet of Bodies, more and more nano sensors and robots will be embedded in our body, turning us into a quantifiable information platform that can be easily commoditized and even manipulated remotely.\nBy collecting all this data, data owners will be able to develop very detailed profiles of the population that can be used to enhance surveillance and security defined by authorities.\nKlaus Schwab, founder of the WEF and proponent of the Great Reset, believes that the pandemic and lockdowns are an opportunity to spread this technological use, which “will result in a fusion of our physical, digital, and biological identities”.\n\nHis aim is to overcome our human limitations by integrating enough technology into the body and placed within the Fourth Industrial Revolution framework.\nIn the 2020 WEF article “Tracking how our bodies work could change our lives”published when the Great Reset was formally announced in June 2020, Xiao Liu wrote: “We’re entering the era of the “Internet of Bodies”: Collecting our physical data via a range of devices that can be implanted, swallowed, or worn.” \n“With big data analytics, countless day-to-day actions and decisions can ultimately feed into our health profile, which may be created and maintained not just by traditional healthcare providers, but also by tech companies or other entities.”\nThis is now being stepped up a gear with a new WEF article published Aug 16, 2022 – titled: “Augmented tech can change the way we live, but only with the right support and vision” written by Kathleen Philips Vice President of R&D at IMEC.\nShe suggests “we’re already making the first strides towards an “augmented society”.\nPushing the idea that we humans must be augmented/fused with technology to perform so called smart tasks, the goal is have the mass population of the world micro chipped:\n“Are we moving towards a ‘brave new world’? As scary as chip implants may sound, they form part of a natural evolution that wearables once underwent.”\n“The augmenting technology will help in all stages of life: Children in a learning environment, professionals at work and ambitious senior citizens. There are many possibilities.”\n\n\nAll in the mind:\nShe advocated the use of various technologies which will no doubt be sold as doing some positive good such as “implants linked to medical conditions”. Or for “Someone on long-term medication may want to try an implant that sends very precise electrical or optical pulses instead.” And other augmentation and technological aids such as glasses, cochlear implants or prosthetics designed to restore a lost or impaired function.\nBut she mixes this up with a much more sinister aspects, such as “Brain implants take us one step further and allow us to tap straight into the body’s “operating system”.\nShe admits that “brain implants may not be the first choice in our augmented society.”, that’s because it will be more subtle augmentation to begin with, smart devices, digital identities, and biometrics.\nThe WEF makes a clear case that implanting chips into children could be viewed by parents as a “solid, rational” move. The WEF calls AR and similar tech transformative – but in need of “the right support, vision, and audacity.”\n“As scary as chip implants may sound, they form part of a natural evolution that wearables once underwent. Hearing aids or glasses no longer carry a stigma,” the blog post reads.\n“They are accessories and are even considered a fashion item. Likewise, implants will evolve into a commodity.”\nAll this real-time health data and the Internet of Bodies leads to programmable freedom, programmable money, and programmable people, or “hackable humans,” as WEF adviser Yuval Harari describes them.\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin (Ad)\nRecently both Amazon and Mastercard have been trailing their new technology platforms and frameworks within the retail environment.\nBecause now “With a smile or a wave, paying in store just got personal”. Mastercard recently unleashed new era of biometric payments to enhance the checkout experience and all it will require is a quick smile or wave of your hand.\nAnd Amazon’s palm-reading payment technology will expand to dozens of Whole Foods locations across California.\nShoppers will be able to pay for groceries by scanning the palm of their hand at checkout devices instead of using cash or card, as this is more evidence of the emergence of a cashless society.\nUsing biometrics and digital identities Amazon and Mastercard hope to transform and streamline modern retail environments using biometric checkout services.\n\n\nWe are already seeing the rollout of global digital identities; the first phase of this is to rollout apps on phones, but the next iteration would be more invasive, having your digital wallets embedded inside your body in a form of an Internet of Bodies implant.\nYou could for example use this to pay for things and to validate your digital identity at checkouts to ensure a “more seamless payment experience to users.”\nEarlier this year the World Economic Forum produced a 46-page report explaining its plans for a worldwide unifying digital identity data management policy.\nThe WEF’s report defines digital ID as “an electronic ID (…) equivalent to an individual’s identity card, which is a way to provide verified information about a person to a program for processing.”\n\nThe report, Advancing Digital Agency: The Power of Data Intermediaries, written by members of the Task Force on Data Intermediaries at the WEF, describes how the initiative would centralize data about social media, taxes, voting, food traceability, healthcare, telecommunications, and commercial and personal business transactions.\n“Effectively, globally positioned central databases would pull together the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Bodies (IoB), and global e-commerce data, among other data points, as it relates to business and personal information.”\nAs such, the WEF would like to see the IoB regulated uniformly across the globe, and the Davos elite continuously calls for ethical governance, but that does not negate the surveillance aspects. After consenting to the draconian measures disguised as serving the greater good, everybody would be spied on equally.\nAccording to the WEF Global Risks 2019 report, the IoB relies heavily on collecting biometric data, which will “allow new forms of social control.” \nIn the same report they write that this is a Digital Panopticon:\n\nThis transformative technology – augmented reality is also set to transform our jobs and even how we shop in the future.\n\nWEF Say \"Augmented Retail is Coming Soon in the #Metaverse\" – Mark Edward Rose.The Rise of the Stay-at-Home Economy?https://t.co/lpS2OToYZ2#WEF #WEF22  #Web3 #NFTs #DavosAgenda pic.twitter.com/OMxr1RwJKW\n— Sikh For Truth (@SikhForTruth) May 24, 2022\n\n\n“Augmented Retail is Coming Soon in the Metaverse” – Declared Mark Edward Rose at this year’s Davos gathering. This is part of The Rise of the Stay-at-Home Economy.\nNow, biometrics are being introduced in retail stores to prepare us for the Metaverse, which at its core is social engineering.\nThe Metaverse will also see humans inhabit the digital unknown and digital identities will play a starring role.\nDo you know who else will play a starring role?

The elites in Davos appear very eager to govern these new immersive virtual worlds and to control the data outputted to further reshape society in their own technocratic image.\n\nThe continued acceleration of technology transformation will mean the 'Smart Phone' will become obsolete, “All technologies would be directly embedded into our bodies.” – Pekka Lundmark – President & CEO of Nokia. #WEF #WEF22 #Davos2022 #6G #Metaversehttps://t.co/XhdIqliqWL pic.twitter.com/pxGPp4gEkx\n— Sikh For Truth (@SikhForTruth) May 27, 2022\n\nAt this year’s WEF event we had the head honcho Pekka Lundmark the President and CEO of Nokia, he came out to declare that “The continued acceleration of technology transformation will mean the Smart Phone [as we know it] will become obsolete, “All technologies would be directly embedded into our bodies.”\nThe Great Reset and it’s broader Fourth Industrial Revolution is dramatically expanding the surveillance state with real-time tracking of data and phones, digital identity and wallets embedded into the body.\nIt started with the mandates that people receive digital certificates to travel, then the current push for global digital identities which will link up all our data footprints and data sources. The next step is to have that technology augmented, implanted into people’s bodies to monitor them directly.\nOf course, all of this is being sold for convenience that technology will support us, and it will improve our overall quality of life. But underneath it all is nothing more than mass surveillance where our every move could be monitored, nudged, and corralled.\nSource: Truth Talk UK\nSikh For Truth — A Digital Identity Futurist and Editor of Truth Talk UK\nMore posts by Sikh For Truth\n\nOr support us at SubscribeStar\nDonate cryptocurrency HERE\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.

        "title": "Judges Are Now Using Their Retirements as Leverage Against the President",
        "content": "\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        Jurisprudence\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n        \n      \n\nJoe Biden speaks during a signing ceremony for H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on August 16, 2022.\nMandel Ngan/Getty Images\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n          Court reformers usually focus their attention on expanding or imposing term limits on the Supreme Court, but recent events in the lower courts are making another kind of reform urgent—even inevitable. Judges have begun to leverage their retirements to make inappropriate demands of the executive branch. Congress or the courts have to put a stop to it.Federal judges have long retired with no strings attached, but that tradition began to crack near the end of the Trump administration. In 2018, Judge Michael Kanne of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit startled the legal community by withdrawing his announced retirement out of pique that his former clerk wouldn’t be selected as his replacement.Now, under the Biden administration, the dam seems about to burst. In just the past year, at least three federal judges have reportedly used their retirements to set up a quid pro quo. And still other examples are rumored. These jurists have used the carrot of a promised retirement, or the threat of rescinding a retirement already announced, to make demands of the president.The most recent incident involves Judge David Hurd of the Northern District of New York. After he had announced his retirement and the president publicly nominated his successor, Hurd wrote to the president that his retirement plans were scotched. Why? Because the judge objected that his successor’s office would be located in Albany, New York, rather than Utica.Behavior like Hurd’s must stop. Retiring judges have no authority to dictate policy either to their successors or to the president. But with politics so polarized, presidents have a powerful interest in filling seats with their preferred nominees. By taking advantage of that fact, Hurd and other judges are exercising authority far outside their jurisdiction.The results are alarming. Hurd, though still a sitting federal judge, has now become enmeshed in politics. And his would-be successor, nominee Jorge Rodriguez, has seemingly been left high and dry. That result lays waste to work on the Rodriguez nomination, is personally unfair to the nominee, and will make it harder to entice qualified candidates to the bench.Hurd’s example is bound to prompt additional manipulative retirements. The president and his allies reportedly tried to placate the judge by offering various promises about where Rodriguez, if he became a judge, would work. But the president has to be careful: if he offers too much to retiring judges, then even more judges will soon come calling, demands in hand.Hurd’s stated reason for rescinding his decision has the appearance of being rooted in the public interest, or at least Utica’s. By contrast, other judges have recently tried to install their favorite clerks as their successors. But if demands like Hurd’s can prevail, then how many other quirky policies or personal favors could a retiring judge insist on? With little if anything to lose, federal judges are likely to push the envelope ever farther.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  Rather than bow to Hurd’s edicts, the president should use this incident to push for change. One option is to hold the judge to his retirement announcement, thereby inviting clarifying litigation. There is an argument, for example, that a judicial retirement cannot be rescinded once a replacement has been named. Or the president could heed recent calls for an ethics rule or statute barring judges from reneging on, or bargaining over, their retirements.\n\n  Best of all, the president could use this case to promote court reform from the bottom up. Reforms that check flagrant abuses in the lower federal courts can help set the stage for reforms directed at the Supreme Court. If federal judges like Hurd were bound by their resignations, for instance, then justices of the Supreme Court could be as well.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  And making the justices’ resignations binding would bring huge benefits. Not only would it prevent Hurd’s shenanigans from spreading to the highest court in the land, but it could also allow the justices to commit to retire after a fixed term of service. In other words, the justices themselves could create Supreme Court term limits. And doing so might prove attractive, especially if it helps to stave off more intrusive reforms, like court-packing.\n\n  The president is reluctant to move court reform to the top of his agenda. But escalating abuse by lower court judges may force his hand—and a good thing, too.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n",

        "title": "Russia's war at 6 months: A global economy in growing danger",
        "content": "MECKENHEIM, Germany (AP) — Martin Kopf needs natural gas to run his family’s company, Zinkpower GmbH, which rustproofs steel components in western Germany.Zinkpower’s facility outside Bonn uses gas to keep 600 tons of zinc worth 2.5 million euros ($2.5 million) in a molten state every day. The metal will harden otherwise, wrecking the tank where steel parts are dipped before they end up in car suspensions, buildings, solar panels and wind turbines.Six months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the consequences are posing a devastating threat to the global economy, including companies like Zinkpower, which employs 2,800 people. Gas is not only much more costly, it might not be available at all if Russia completely cuts off supplies to Europe to avenge Western sanctions, or if utilities can’t store enough for winter.Germany may have to impose gas rationing that could cripple industries from steelmaking to pharmaceuticals to commercial laundries. “If they say, we’re cutting you off, all my equipment will be destroyed,” said Kopf, who’ also chairs Germany’s association of zinc galvanizing firms.Governments, businesses and families worldwide are feeling the war’s economic effects just two years after the coronavirus pandemic ravaged global trade. Inflation is soaring, and rocketing energy costs have raised the prospect of a cold, dark winter. Europe stands at the brink of recession.High food prices and shortages, worsened by the cutoff of fertilizer and grain shipments from Ukraine and Russia that are slowly resuming, could produce widespread hunger and unrest in the developing world.Outside Uganda’s capital of Kampala, Rachel Gamisha said Russia’s war in faraway Ukraine has hurt her grocery business. She has felt it in surging prices for necessities like gasoline, selling for $6.90 a gallon. Something that’s 2,000 shillings (about $16.70) this week may cost 3,000 shillings ($25) next week. “You have to limit yourself,” she said. “You have to buy a few things that move fast.’’Gamisha has noticed something else, too — a phenomenon called “shrinkflation”: A price may not change, but a doughnut that used to weigh 45 grams may now be only 35 grams. Bread that weighed 1 kilogram is now 850 grams.Russia’s war led the International Monetary Fund last month to downgrade its outlook for the global economy for the fourth time in under a year. The lending agency expects 3.2% growth this year, down from the 4.9% it forecast in July 2021 and well below a vigorous 6.1% last year. “The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, said.The U.N. Development Program said rising food and energy prices threw 71 million people worldwide into poverty in the first three months of the war. Countries in the Balkans and sub-Saharan Africa were hit hardest. Up to 181 million people in 41 countries could suffer a hunger crisis this year, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has projected.In Bangkok, rising costs for pork, vegetables and oil have forced Warunee Deejai, a street-food vendor, to raise prices, cut staff and work longer hours. “I don’t know how long I can keep my lunch price affordable,” she said. “Coming out from COVID lockdowns and having to face this is tough. Worse is, I don’t see the end of it.’’Even before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, the global economy was under pressure. Inflation had skyrocketed as a stronger-than-expected recovery from the pandemic recession overwhelmed factories, ports and freight yards, causing delays, shortages and higher prices. In response, central banks began raising interest rates to try to cool economic growth and tame spiking prices. “We’ve all got all these different things going on,” said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the International Institute of Finance. “The volatility of inflation went up. The volatility of growth went up. And therefore, it’s become infinitely harder for central banks to steer the ship.’’China, pursuing a zero-COVID policy, imposed lockdowns that have severely weakened the world’s second-biggest economy. At the time, many developing countries still grappled with the pandemic and the heavy debts they had taken on to protect their populations from economic disaster.All those challenges might have been manageable. But when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the West responded with heavy sanctions. Both actions disrupted trade in food and energy. Russia is the world’s third-biggest petroleum producer and a leading exporter of natural gas, fertilizer and wheat. Farms in Ukraine feed millions globally.The resulting inflation has rippled out to the world.Near Johannesburg, South Africa, Stephanie Muller has been comparing prices online and checking different grocery stores to find the best deals. “I have three children who are all in school, so I have been feeling the difference,” she said.Shopping at a market in Vietnam’s capital of Hanoi, Bui Thu Huong said she’s been limiting her spending and cutting back on weekend dinners out. At least there’s one advantage to cooking at home with her children: “We can bond with them more in the kitchen, while saving money at the same time.”Syahrul Yasin Limpo, Indonesia’s agriculture minister, warned this month that the price of instant noodles, a staple in the Southeast Asian nation, might triple because of inflated wheat prices. In neighboring Malaysia, vegetable farmer Jimmy Tan laments that fertilizer prices are up 50%. He’s also paying more for supplies like plastic sheets, bags and hoses.In Karachi, Pakistan, far from the battlefields of Ukraine, Kamran Arif has taken a second, part-time job to supplement his wages. “Because we have no control on prices, we can only try to increase our income,” he said.A vast majority of people live in poverty in Pakistan, whose currency has lost up to 30% of its value against the dollar and the government has increased electricity prices 50%.Muhammad Shakil, an importer and exporter, says he can no longer get wheat, white chickpeas and yellow peas from Ukraine.“Now that we have to import from other countries, we have to buy at higher prices” — sometimes 10%-15% more, Shakil said.As the war fuels inflation, central banks are raising interest rates to try to slow price increases without derailing economic growth.The resulting increase in loan rates is punishing FlooringStores, a New York company that helps customers find flooring material and contractors. Sales are down because fewer homeowners are borrowing to pay for home improvements.“A huge percentage of our customers finance their projects with home-equity loans and similar products, meaning that the hike in interest rates really killed our business,” CEO Todd Saunders said. “Inflation wasn’t helping, but the interest rates had a bigger effect.’’Europe, which for years depended on Russian oil and natural gas for its industrial economy, has absorbed a gut punch. It faces the growing threat of recession as the Kremlin throttles back flows of natural gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and fire up factories. Prices are 15 times what they were before Russia massed troops on the Ukrainian border in March 2021.“There’s a lot more recessionary risk and pressure in Europe than in the rest of the high-income economies,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Bank of England policymaker. The damage has hardly spared Russia, whose economy the IMF expects to contract 6% this year. Sergey Aleksashenko, a Russian economist now living in the United States, noted that the country’s retail sales tumbled 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier as consumers cut back. “They have no money to spend,” he said.___Wiseman reported from Washington.

        "title": "Liz Cheney on stopping Trump, Pence testifying on Jan. 6: 'This Week' exclusive",
        "content": "GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, once a rising star in the Republican Party and considered a potential speaker of the House, told ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl she has no regrets about her political career, including her landslide primary election loss in Wyoming on Tuesday, saying she is now laser-focused on keeping Donald Trump out of the White House.In an exclusive wide-ranging interview for ABC's \"This Week,\" Cheney also discussed the FBI search at the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate – calling the investigation a very serious development and saying she is \"ashamed\" at some of her Republican colleagues who have attacked the Justice Department and the FBI.Cheney, who serves as vice chair of the Jan. 6 Select Committee investigating the Capitol attack -- and speaking with Karl in the committee hearing room -- also said she still hopes former Vice President Mike Pence testifies before the panel in the near future, adding that conversations with his legal team are ongoing.Rep. Liz Cheney speaks with ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jon Karl, Aug. 19, 2022, in Washington, D.C.Quinn Scanlan/ABC NewsCheney 'ashamed' at Republican colleagues' reaction to Mar-a-Lago searchDuring her sit-down interview with ABC's Karl, Cheney weighed in on the FBI's search executed at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence earlier this month and said she was ashamed that congressional Republicans had leapt to Trump's defense and had accused the Justice Department of political malice.\"That's a very serious thing. I think that when you think about the fact that we were in a position where the FBI, the Department of Justice, felt the need to execute a search warrant at the home of a former president -- that's a really serious thing for the nation,\" she said.Rep. Liz Cheney speaks with ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jon Karl, Aug. 19, 2022, in Washington, D.C.ABC NewsThe redacted copy of the search warrant released sent shockwaves through Washington, as it revealed the Justice Department was investigating the potential violation of at least three separate criminal statutes in its search of Mar a Lago, including obstruction of justice and one crime under the Espionage Act.A property receipt accompanying the warrant shows agents seized multiple boxes of documents of various classifications, including one set referring to \"classified/TS/SCI documents\" (the acronym stands for top secret/sensitive compartmentalized information that not everyone with even top-secret clearance can view) and four other sets of top-secret documents.Trump's team has yet to take court action despite publicly trying to pressure the Justice Department to release the full affidavit underlying the warrant.Trump in recent days has called for the \"immediate release\" of the affidavit while leveling various attacks at the FBI and Justice Department, while also demanding over his social media website that the documents be returned to him.Following the raid, a growing list of Republicans tweeted, with some attacking the Justice Department and the FBI, including House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.He tweeted a statement that read, in part, \"The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization.\"\"I was ashamed to hear Republicans immediately and reflexively attack the FBI agents who executed the search warrant,\" Cheney said.Rep. Liz Cheney speaks with ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jon Karl, Aug. 19, 2022, in Washington, D.C.Quinn Scanlan/ABC NewsCheney also accused Trump of releasing the unredacted search warrant to media organizations who then posted its contents without removing the names of the agents involved. Law enforcement agencies around the country are actively monitoring growing strains of angry online rhetoric and threats that have emerged in the wake of the raid.\"I was disgusted when I learned that President Trump had released the names of those agents, when he released the unredacted search warrant, and that has now caused violence,\" Cheney said.ABC News has not confirmed Cheney's claim.\"We've seen threats of violence, the judge himself, his synagogue had to cancel services because of threats of violence. This is a really dangerous moment and to see the former president of the United States, my colleagues stoking the flames of that instead of saying, 'We need to learn the facts. We need to learn the evidence we need to learn the information about what happened … I think that the American people see what hypocrisy that is and it's dangerous hypocrisy,\" Cheney said.\"I've seen no evidence that there was any political motivation,\" Cheney added, in response to some of her Republican colleagues who have accused the DOJ of that.A magistrate judge in Florida on Thursday said, despite Justice Department objections, he may seek to unseal portions of the affidavit.After hearing in-person arguments on a request from a coalition of media outlets to make the affidavit public, the judge said he might decide that at least a portion of the affidavit could be unsealed with government redactions.The Justice Department had urged the judge, Bruce Reinhart, to keep the affidavit fully under seal, arguing that if it were to be made public it could \"cause significant and irreparable damage\" to an ongoing criminal investigation involving highly classified materials related to national security.\"I think that will provide us additional information,\" Cheney said. \"It sounds to me from watching. The news reports that they're acting responsibly in terms of determining what has to be redacted and, and what can be released. But it also seems to be the case that there were clearly ongoing efforts to get back wherever this information was, and that it was not presented, you know, that the former president was unwilling to give back these materials. Now, we will see, we'll learn more,\" Cheney said.\"It's a really serious thing and I just think that for us as a party to be in a position where we're reflexively attacking career law enforcement professionals in order to defend a former president who conducted himself the way this one did, is it's really sad day for the party,\" Cheney said.\"Could it be that his handling of government records, classified information -- that that could be what brings Donald Trump down after all of this?\" Karl asked.\"I mean, look, well, we'll see. Everyone has an obligation and a responsibility. And, you know, clearly, the handling of classified information is something that's really serious, so, I don't know all of the aspects of why the search warrant was executed, certainly. But, you know, we'll see as additional information comes out.\"Rep. Liz Cheney, Vice Chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, delivers remarks during the fifth hearing, June 23, 2022, in Washington, D.C.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesCheney hopes Pence will testify to Jan. 6 committee, possible Trump could be asked Cheney told Karl that she hopes that former Vice President Mike Pence will testify before the Jan. 6 Select Committee in the near future.Pence had indicated this week that he would consider testifying before the committee if he were invited to do so.\"We've been in discussions with his counsel,\" Cheney said.\"Look, he played a critical role on January 6, if he had succumbed to the pressure that Donald Trump was putting on him, we would have had a much worse constitutional crisis. And I think that he has clearly, as he's expressed, concerns about executive privilege, which, you know, I have tremendous respect. I think it's, it's, you know, hugely important constitutional issue in terms of separation of powers,\" she said.\"I believe in executive privilege. I think it matters. But I also think that when the country has been through something, as grave as this was, everyone who has information has an obligation to step forward. So, I would hope that that he will do that,\" Cheney said.\"So, you think we'll see him here in September in this room before the committee?\" Karl asked.\"I would hope that he will understand how important it is for the American people to know every aspect of the truth about what happened that day,\" Cheney said.Cheney was asked if Trump would be asked to testify and she indicated that it remains a possibility.\"I don't want to make any announcements about that this morning. So, let me just leave it there,\" she said.\"But it's possible you would ask him, before wrapping up, to testify?\" Karl pressed.\"Yes. I mean, I don't -- again, I don't want to get in front of committee deliberations about that. I do think it's very important, as I said in the first hearing or the second hearing, you know, his interactions with our committee will be under oath,\" Cheney replied.Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at \"Politics & Eggs\" at the New Hampshire Institute Politics at St. Anselm College on Aug. 17, 2022 in Manchester, N.H.Scott Eisen/Getty ImagesCheney not concerned with Republican retribution Cheney told Karl that she expects transcripts, records and other materials gathered by the committee over the course of its investigation will be made public.\"Yeah, it's all public record. It will be it will be available publicly as our investigation wraps up and concludes,\" Cheney said.She said she will willingly appear if she is ever subpoenaed in the future should a Republican-led House choose to investigate members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, which some Republicans have called for.\"If Kevin McCarthy or Jim Jordan, or any of the other individuals who are trying to investigate the committee, carry through on that threat, and issue a subpoena for me to appear, I will abide by that subpoena and I will welcome the opportunity to come and explain to them exactly what we found and the threat that Donald Trump poses to the country,\" Cheney said.\"And I would say, you know, they ought to do the same. They are all completely shirking their obligations and their responsibilities to come and testify about what they know. And I think, again, that's an abdication of their responsibility under the Constitution,\" Cheney said.Rep. Liz Cheney gives a concession speech to supporters during a primary night event, Aug. 16, 2022, in Jackson, Wyo.Alex Wong/Getty ImagesCheney: 'No regrets' about political career, primary loss \"I think that it was clear, really, from the beginning -- the moment that I voted to impeach -- that there were going to be potential political consequences,\" Cheney told Karl of her vote to impeach Trump.Cheney admitted that had she wanted to save her political career and her seat in the House -- a seat she has held for nearly six years -- it would have required something of her that she was unwilling to do: \"[It] would have required embracing the lie about the election, would have required enabling that and I just simply wasn't willing to do that. So, you know, at each moment, I knew that I had to do what was right,\" Cheney said.\"And this wasn't just losing a House seat. I mean, you were considered, you were in leadership, you were considered a future Speaker of the House, maybe even the next Speaker of the House. It's a lot to give up. Any regrets?\" Karl asked Cheney.\"No regrets,\" Cheney replied.\"I feel I feel sad about where my party is. I feel sad about the way that too many of my colleagues have responded to what I think is a great moral test and challenge of our time -- a great moment to determine whether or not people are going to stand up on behalf of the democracy, on behalf of our republic,\" Cheney said.\"And so, it does make me sad that so many people have failed the test, but certainly no regrets. I mean, to me, there's just never been any question about what was the right way to operate here and the right thing to do,\" she added.Following her election loss Tuesday, Cheney said she received a phone call from none other than the current president: Joe Biden.\"I did hear from President Biden. We had a very, very good talk -- a talk about the importance of putting the country ahead of partisanship,\" she said, adding that she had also heard from some of her Republican colleagues in Congress but she did not name them.\"I think that there are a number of my colleagues who have done the right thing. I would you know, put certainly those of us who voted to impeach in that category, a number of others who expressed the view that, you know, they're supportive, they wish they would have done the right thing. And many others who, you know, have simply chosen another path,\" Cheney said.Of the nine other House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Trump in 2021 for his role in inciting an insurrection, Cheney said they will forever be bonded by that vote.\"I think that it is a bond. It's a bond and we've talked about it, you know, we have a difference of opinion, differences of opinion among the 10 of us about a whole range of issues of other issues, but, the fact that we all made the decision we did and have faced consequences for that decision, will be a bond I would imagine forever,\" she said.Former President Donald Trump waves while walking to a vehicle in New York City on Aug. 10, 2022.Stringer/AFP via Getty ImagesCalls large portions of Republican Party who still support Trump 'very sick'\"I think that clearly his hold is very strong among some portions of the Republican Party,\" Cheney said, reflecting on her primary election loss.\"I think, one, it says that people continue to believe the lie, they continue to believe what he's saying, which is very dangerous. I think it also tells you that large portions of our party, including the leadership of our party, both at the state level in Wyoming, as well as on a national level with the RNC, is very sick,\" Cheney said.\"We really have got to decide whether or not we're going to be a party based on substance and policy or whether we're going to remain as so many of our party are today, in the grips of a dangerous former president,\" she said.Cheney doubled down on what she believes her principles are in the face of a Republican Party still in the grips of the former president and what she will continue to fight for as she considers her political future.\"What I'm fighting for is the Constitution. What I'm fighting for is the perpetuation of the Republic. What I'm fighting for is the rule of law -- the fact that everybody's got to abide by the rule of law. What I'm fighting for is the fact that elections have to matter and that when the election is over, and the courts have ruled and the electoral college is met, that the president of the United States has to respect the results of the election. What I'm fighting for is the principle that we have a peaceful transition of power, and that we don't determine who rules based upon violence,\" she said.Highlights new effort to take down Trump Cheney is hoping to turn her landslide loss in the primary into a nationwide crusade to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. She plans to launch a political organization in the coming weeks to educate the American people about ongoing threats to the country, and to mobilize a unified effort to oppose any Donald Trump campaign for president.\"First of all, obviously, we have tremendous work left to do on the select committee, tremendous work left to do as Wyoming's representative in Congress. Also, I'm going to be very focused on working to ensure that we do everything we can not to elect election deniers,\" Cheney said.\"I think that we've got election deniers that have been nominated for really important positions all across the country. And I'm going to work against those people. I'm going to work to support their opponents. I think it matters that much,\" she said.\"And I'm also going to spend a lot of time doing everything I can to help educate the American people about what happened. And I think our hearings have been a tremendous contribution to that. And I think it's really important for people you know, really across the political spectrum of all ages to understand and recognize why what happened after the last election can never happen again,\" Cheney said.Cheney still considering a 2024 presidential run and will likely decide after her tenure in the House is overCheney refused to provide further clarity on her own possible presidential run, simply saying that she is still weighing her options.\"I'm focused on this from the perspective of substance, and I really think the country faces grave threats and as I sort of go through finishing my work here in Congress over the next several months, and making a decision about how I can best help to ensure that we right our political ship, you know, I'll make decisions about what comes next,\" Cheney told Karl.\"You run for president because you believe you would be the best, the best candidate because you believe you'd be the best president United States. And so, any decision that I make about doing something that significant and that serious would be with the intention of winning and because I think I would be the best candidate,\" she said.Asked by Karl if she would run as an independent candidate,\"I'm not going to go down that path anymore in terms of speculating – today,\" she said with a laugh.\"I mean, look, I'm really very focused. We have a huge amount of work to do. You and I are sitting here in the Cannon Caucus room. We have a huge amount of work left to do with respect to the Select Committee, and I have really important work left to do representing Wyoming for the next several months and that that is really my focus. And I will make decisions about what comes next after that,\" she said.Cheney won't support Trump in 2024, or fellow 'election deniers' \"You told me a little over a year ago, that you didn't think Donald Trump could win the Republican nomination again. You said there are millions and millions of Republicans that wouldn't let that happen. Do you still believe that? I mean, right now he looks like the overwhelming front runner,\" Karl asked Cheney.\"I think we have to make sure that he is not our nominee,\" Cheney said.\"I believe in Republican policies, I believe if you think about where the country needs to go, what's best for our nation, I believe in a strong national defense, certainly today more than ever. We need that to confront the threats we face. I believe in low taxes. I believe in limited government. I believe the family should be the center of our lives and our communities – those are traditional Republican values. And I believe that's what we need going into the future,\" Cheney said.\"I think that we have no chance at winning elections if we are in a position where our party has abandoned principle and abandoned value and abandoned fundamental fidelity of the Constitution in order to embrace a cult of personality. And I think that's really dangerous for a whole bunch of reasons,\" she said.Cheney said Trump has created a movement that Americans must look beyond if the Republican Party is to survive.\"Donald Trump is certainly the center of the threat. And I think that you know, what he's done and what he's created is a movement on some level that is post truth. And I think that you know, certainly social media has added to that. But election denial, denying the fundamental function and principle – what is at the center of our constitutional republic is dangerous, broadly speaking, and he is certainly leading that effort, leading that movement,\" Cheney said.\"Because we know precisely what he will do, because he has done it, you know, sending an armed mob here to the Capitol to try to overturn the results of an election. There's just simply no way that the nation can, in my view, sustain itself if we excuse that and put him in a position of power again,\" Cheney said.\"I think that as a nation, whether we're Republicans or Democrats or independents, we all have to reject that,\" Cheney said. \"And I believe that there is a coalition of people across the party spectrum, who understand we've certainly seen it on our committee. We've seen it around the country, people who understand we can agree that there are certain issues we're never going to agree on politically, but we have to come together, you know, cross those party lines, in order to protect ourselves against that kind of threat,\" she said.Cheney said she would find it difficult to support a future Republican presidential candidate who has aligned his or herself with Trump, pointing to Republicans Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as examples.\"It would be very difficult,\" Cheney said. \"I think that a fundamental question for me in terms of whether or not someone is fit to be president, is whether they've abided by their constitutional obligations in the past.\"\"I think certainly when you look at somebody like Josh Hawley, or somebody like Ted Cruz, both of whom know better, both of whom know exactly what the role of Congress is, in terms of our constitutional obligations with respect to presidential elections, and yet both of whom took steps that fundamentally threatened the constitutional order and structure in the aftermath of the last election. So, you know, in my view, they both have made themselves unfit for future office,\" she said.\"DeSantis is somebody who is right now campaigning for election deniers. And I think that, you know, that is something that we've got to have real pause about. Either you fundamentally believe in and will support our constitutional structure, or you don't,\" she said.\"I don't believe he should be Speaker of the House.\" Rep. Liz Cheney tells @jonkarl that Rep. Kevin McCarthy has been \"completely unfaithful to the Constitution, and demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the significance and the importance of the role of speaker.\" pic.twitter.com/KizWZ0L5vE— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) August 19, 2022 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is followed by reporter as he walks to his office on Capitol Hill, Aug. 12, 2022.Susan Walsh/APCheney slams McCarthy: 'He's been completely unfaithful to the Constitution' Cheney said she will campaign against any Republican candidates who deny election results, including her colleagues in Congress like McCarthy.McCarthy, bucking tradition, endorsed Cheney's primary challenger Harriet Hageman in Tuesday's race.Cheney and McCarthy have had a notably strained relationship since she was booted from House leadership in 2021 over her repeated criticisms of Trump. GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York was her eventual replacement in leadership.Karl asked Cheney, \"Is the country better or worse off if Kevin McCarthy is the next speaker of the House?\"\"Well, my views about Kevin McCarthy are very clear,\" Cheney said. \"The speaker of the House is the second in line for the presidency. It requires somebody who understands and recognizes their duty, their oath, their obligation and he's been completely unfaithful to the Constitution and demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the significance and importance of the role of speaker, so I don't believe he should be speaker of the House and I think that's been very clear.\"\"So, it sounds like that's a yes, the country would be worse off if he were speaker?\" Karl asked.\"I don't believe he should be speaker of the House,\" Cheney said.",

        "content": "Washington state authorities arrested a man they say was armed with guns outside a crowded music festival on Friday.\"Grant County sheriff’s deputies on Friday night believe they stopped an Ephrata man who may have had plans to commit a mass shooting at the Gorge Amphitheatre,\" the sheriff's office said in a news release. People at the Bass Canyon Music Festival, a three-day electronic dance music event at the Gorge Amphitheatre in George, reported a suspicious man to authorities around 9 p.m. in the parking lot, according to the release. Witnesses said they saw a man inhale an unknown substance or gas from a balloon and load two pistols from the trunk of his car before concealing one in his waistband and the other in a holster, officials said. The man, who the sheriff's officer identified as Jonathan R. Moody, 31, approached concertgoers to ask when the concert ended and where people would be exiting from, according to authorities. Venue security then detained Moody outside of the site and disarmed him of two loaded 9mm pistols. He did not enter the venue, officials said.  MASS KILLINGS DATABASE: Database reveals trends, details and anguish in every US event since 2006LOLLAPALOOZA: Security guard faked mass shooting threat 'to leave work early,' prosecutors sayMoody was arrested by deputies on one count of possession of a dangerous weapon and one count of unlawful carrying or handling of a weapon. He is currently held at Grant County Jail.Authorities said the Friday night of the Bass Canyon Music Festival was sold out, meaning there were at least 25,000 people in attendance. The festival also had campgrounds for attendees near the venue, according to its website.No injuries related to the incident were reported.\"Remember: if you see something, say something. Citizens saw something completely out of place for the circumstances and notified security, who in turn notified deputies. That combination of situational awareness along with noticing 'something does not fit' resulted in a possible tragedy being prevented,\" the Grant County Sheriff's Office said.Bass Canyon also thanked concertgoers for reporting the suspect to security in their own statement on Twitter, adding he did not have a wristband to enter the festival and thanking authorities \"for handling the situation.\"Follow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.",

        "title": "Does Federal Law Protect Abortions in Medical Emergencies?",
        "content": "\n                  In the weeks since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, physicians around the country have struggled to navigate new legal landscapes when providing care for patients experiencing emergency medical conditions, including ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages, preeclampsia, and other severe pregnancy complications.                  Federal health care law already required that physicians treat pregnant people—and all patients—in medical emergencies and provide care to stabilize them, regardless of state laws around specific procedures or the patient’s ability to pay. The Biden Administration issued guidance last month that explicitly reminded providers abortion is included those scenarios, and said doctors are protected if they terminate a patient’s pregnancy as part of emergency treatment, even in a state that now bans the procedure.FDA Recommends New Monkeypox Vaccine Strategy to Stretch SupplyPosted 11 Days Ago                                    But now that new guidance is facing its first two legal tests as lawsuits in Texas and Idaho head to court. The outcomes in either case could have major implications for how physicians understand state abortion laws, whether they can provide abortions in emergency situations even in states that have banned it, and what kind of care pregnant patients can expect in their home states.                   The first case comes from Texas, which sued the federal government last month to block the guidance, arguing it amounted to an “abortion mandate” that unlawfully tries to preempt the state’s near-total abortion ban. The initial hearing in that case occurred on Aug. 18. Separately, the Biden Administration’s Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Idaho, which has an abortion law that leaves doctors facing criminal penalties for providing abortions under any circumstances, including when the mother’s life is at risk. The Idaho case is the first time the Biden Administration has taken proactive steps to block a state’s abortion ban since the fall of Roe. The first hearing in that case is scheduled for Aug. 22. Both state laws are set to take effect Aug. 25, so the cases could move quickly through the courts before then— and may get appealed to higher courts before a final resolution.\n    \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n                                    At issue is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), the law on which the Biden Administration based its July guidance. The Administration has been scrambling to respond to the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, and has been wary of taking actions that could lead to court decisions that would limit executive authority. And while the President has repeatedly said that Congress must act to protect abortion, Democrats lack the votes to pass such legislation in the near future. The Administration has been hoping to use the EMTALA guidance to protect some abortion access in the absence of federal legislation, so what the courts in decide in Texas and Idaho could enhance or severely curtail the executive branch’s ability to weigh in on the issue in restrictive states.                  Here’s what you need to know about how these two cases could affect abortions in emergency situations.                                     The federal health care law                   EMTALA wasn’t originally about red and blue state policy divides. When the law took effect in 1986, it was meant to ensure that patients could get emergency care regardless of their ability to pay.                   The law states that emergency departments must screen patients, and if the patient is in an “emergency medical situation,” the staff is required to provide treatment that will stabilize them. These situations are defined as something that would put the health of the patient in “serious jeopardy” or impair bodily functions unless treated.                  When it comes to pregnancy, “we’re talking about things like ectopic pregnancy, and incomplete miscarriages where there’s a risk of hemorrhage, and preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome,” says Lindsay Wiley, a law professor and director of the Health Law and Policy Program at UCLA Law. “We’re not talking about a run of the mill elective abortion situation.”                   Texas argues that federal law does not allow doctors to provide abortions now banned under its state laws, and that the Biden Administration wants to “transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.” But the Biden Administration, as well as liberal states and medical groups that filed briefs with the court, argue that’s not what the federal government is trying to do. The guidance has not added anything new to federal law, they say, but rather reminded hospitals and physicians that the Administration will enforce the law with respect to abortions. Hospitals that violate EMTALA can lose access to Medicare payments, which would be a major problem for their financial sustainability.                                    “EMTALA is the foundation of emergency medicine in this country for more than 35 years. It has been supported broadly by ideologically diverse coalitions and people,” says Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing a coalition of medical groups that filed briefs supporting the Biden Administration in the Texas and Idaho cases. “The federal government is seeking to enforce a longstanding law that pregnant people and all people are entitled to required and urgent emergency care.”                  What counts as a health exception?                   Right now, abortion laws in all states allow abortions when the pregnant person’s life is at risk. But these exceptions are often not clearly defined, and physicians have been forced to navigate vague laws with the threat of criminal penalties when trying to determine if a pregnant person is in an emergency situation.                   Idaho’s trigger ban, for example, which is set to go into effect Aug. 25, has exceptions for the risk of death to the pregnant person or when the pregnant person has reported rape or incest to law enforcement. But those exceptions can only be used as a defense in a criminal trial after someone has charged the doctor with violating the law—there’s no judgment doctors can make beforehand that will indemnify them if they provide the procedure.                                     EMTALA has a broader definition of what would count as stabilizing treatment, including policies that have been developed to ensure patients can be reasonably transferred or discharged. But Idaho argues there isn’t a significant distance between its legal exceptions and what EMTALA would consider a medical emergency. “The argument is strong that the federal law preempts contrary state laws that come into conflict,” says Elizabeth Sepper, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. “Idaho ended up arguing that there’s no conflict between the Idaho law with this super narrow exception and the instances where EMTALA would require doctors to provide abortions, which are also a relatively narrow range of circumstances, but broader than just life saving.” In other words, Idaho argues its law still allows for the appropriate exceptions under EMTALA, so its enforcement shouldn’t be limited, as the Biden Administration is arguing.                  Read More: Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women                  In Texas, the arguments are in some ways reversed. Texas’ law does include exceptions for the health of the pregnant person, though physicians have said those are still vague. Texas is pushing to block the EMTALA guidance on abortions, so there the Biden Administration has argued that EMTALA is not requiring Texas hospitals and physicians to do anything contrary to its state law.                                     Texas is mainly saying that the Biden Administration’s guidance would unlawfully force doctors in the state to provide abortions in situations that would leave them exposed to criminal penalties under the state’s laws. Texas last year enacted a ban on abortions after about six weeks that is enforced by private civil lawsuits, and its trigger ban outlawing nearly all abortions and adding criminal penalties is set to go into effect Aug. 25.                   If Texas succeeds, the underlying EMTALA law would stay in place, but it would be a blow for the Biden Administration’s strategy on protecting reproductive health. “They want the guidance out there,” Wiley says. “The guidance is meant to be a kind of warning shot, because hospitals are currently actively in this process of working out their internal policies and procedures about how are they going to comply with the Texas state law.”                   In Idaho, the stakes could be even more immediately felt by patients. If the Biden Administration succeeds in challenging the state’s law, it could guarantee that pregnant patients in Idaho will have access to abortions in emergency situations. This still wouldn’t allow the vast majority of abortions to happen in the state, but it would be meaningful for patients in Idaho and elsewhere facing significant health risks. “It would mean that EMTALA shapes the boundaries of where states can go with their abortion bans, that they can go so far and quite far, but that abortions in emergency situations will continue to need to be available,” Sepper says.                                     ‘Just the beginning’                  Whatever the outcome in these cases, the first EMTALA lawsuits are “just the beginning,” says Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who focuses on abortion rights.                  The Texas case serves as a potential test for other conservative states to challenge the Biden Administration’s guidance or actions on abortion, Donley says. If the judge enjoins the federal guidance, it could set precedent or spark copycat suits.                   On the other hand, the Idaho case presents an experiment for the Biden Administration. Reproductive rights advocates have encouraged the Biden Administration to take more action to protect abortion access, particularly around EMTALA, and the Idaho case could indicate whether that will be an effective approach.                  Regardless of how long the cases take to reach a conclusion or which side prevails, some legal experts say the lawsuits are still a good messaging strategy for the Biden Administration. “These lawsuits allow the Biden Administration to continually highlight a very unpopular part of abortion bans right now,” Donley says, “which is that they’re harming maternal health.”                                    Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com.              \n            ",

        "content": "Mexico is considering incentives to attract private investment in semiconductors, taking advantage of a push by the US to bring the production of chips closer to home, according to the Latin American nation’s economy minister.Tatiana Clouthier said on Friday the government is looking to help companies that think about expanding their presence in Mexico and proposals are being evaluated by the Finance Ministry. Additional investment in Mexico will benefit the auto, electronics, and aerospace industries, she added.Tatiana ClouthierPhotographer: Lujan Agusti/Bloomberg“We could have mechanisms to make investment more attractive for companies that relocate,” Clouthier told Bloomberg News in an interview, saying she’s in touch with the Finance Ministry to discuss what can be done to support innovative industries that could boost employment. “We think that for these sectors there should be certain kinds of assistance.”\n        \n    \n        \n    She did not elaborate on what types of incentives are being discussed.\n        \n    Earlier in August, the ministry held a forum with US investors to discuss the advantages of investment in Mexico after the US Congress approved the CHIPS Act, which includes about $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor production and research. Mexico could be a “key ally,” the Economy Ministry said in a statement after the event.\n        \n    Clouthier named Jalisco and Aguascalientes states as potential areas of investment, though the government has also encouraged companies to move to southern states, where there is more water available. Drought has stricken northern cities including Monterrey, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has called for water-guzzling companies to limit production.",

        "title": "San Antonio teen threatened ‘day of retribution’ at Turning Point conservative convention in Florida: FBI",
        "content": "A 19-year-old San Antonio man with reported ties to far-right commentator Nick Fuentes planned to attack a conservative student conference in Florida, according to officials.Alejandro Richard Velasquez Gomez, linked by the FBI to the incel, or “involuntary celibate,” movement, has been charged with one count of making threatening interstate communications and one count of possession of child pornography, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.Velasquez Gomez is allegedly behind a July 18 Instagram post from user @LatinoZoomerPolitics that threatened a “day of retribution” on July 22, the same day as the three-day Turning Point USA conference began in Tampa, Fla.“I will have revenge against all of humanity which all of you will pay for my suffering,” the message read. “SAS will be the turning point of the LatinoZoomer lore.”Alejandro Richard Velasquez Gomez has been charged with making threatening interstate communications. (FBI Handout)SAS, according to the FBI, likely corresponds to Turning Point USA’s Student Action Summit, which this year included former President Trump, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Rep. Lauren Boebert and Rep. Matt Gaetz.The language is strikingly similar to a video by Elliot Rodger, an incel who killed six people, then himself, in Isla Vista, Calif., in May 2014. In the video, Rodger spoke out against the women who had rejected him, blaming them for his suffering.The Daily News FlashWeekdaysCatch up on the day’s top five stories every weekday afternoon.“He explained to me that he intended the post to evoke Elliot Rodger and was familiar with Elliot Rodger due to extensive online research,” the FBI agent wrote in the criminal complaint.After being alerted to the Instagram post, the Tampa Police Department obtained a warrant for Velasquez Gomez’s arrest and charged him with making written or electronic threats to kill, do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism.Velasquez Gomez (FBI Handout)Investigators also found record of a flight Velasquez Gomez had booked from Austin to Tampa, which he canceled the day before the convention was scheduled to start.San Antonio police arrested Velasquez Gomez and FBI searched his phone, which turned up multiple graphic photos of child pornography, according to the criminal complaint.A motive for Velasquez Gomez’s alleged threats has not been revealed, but the San Antonio Express-News tied him to Fuentes who helped lead the “Stop the Steal” movement and has been branded a “white nationalist livestreamer” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Fuentes was banned from a Turning Point event last year.“For the record, Alejandro Velasquez had nothing to do with me or America First,” Fuentes wrote on Telegram Friday.“As far as I’m aware he attended [Conservative Political Action Conference] Dallas last year where I briefly made an appearance. Claims on social media that he was part of our team in any way are completely untrue. Censorship, debanking and blacklisting didn’t work so now they lie.”",

        "content": "Women from around the world have shared videos of themselves dancing on social media in a gesture of support for Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin. One collection of clips showing different staff from a Danish womens’ magazine has attracted thousands of likes on Twitter, while another hilarious video praises the dance moves of Ms Marin, 36, while comparing them with the dancefloor antics of British prime minister Boris Johnson.Ms Marin made headlines in recent days after footage of her partying and dancing enthusiastically on a night out was leaked online. The videos which were taken as she danced with friends in two private apartments and then at a nightclub in Helsinki have led to her being criticised and she was forced to address concerns that someone in one of the clips was heard shouting the words ‘flour gang’ in an apparent reference to a Finnish slang word for cocaine. She insisted at a press conference outside her official residence in Helsinki that she had never taken drugs, had not seen any taken on the night the videos were filmed and had since taken a drugs test to clear her name. Ms Marin also denied doing anything ‘inappropriate’ after another view emerged of her dancing closely with Finnish pop star Olavi Uusivirta, 28, at 4am in the Klubi nightclub in Helsinki. She also insisted that she had not drunk alcohol to excess and had not woken up with a hangover, explaining she has the same right to a night off as everyone else and 'everyone needs a fun and relaxed evening out'.Now other women from Finland and over the world have shared their support for Ms Marin by filming themselves dancing wildly, either by themselves or with friends. A clip shared by the Danish magazine Alt on Instagram showed several women celebrating, with some clubbing or at home to show they stand with the Finnish PM. Woman posts herself dancing in solidarity with Finnish PM's scandal  Loaded: 0%Progress: 0%0:00LIVE \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n  Women from around the world have shared videos of themselves dancing on social media in support of Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin after leaked videos showed her dancing at a party \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n   The glamourous Finnish PM (pictured), 36, has denied using drugs and said she has nothing to hide after a video emerged of her partying wildly with celebrity friendsOne woman even showed her body-bending skills while pole dancing in the video.  The magazine said they had 'leaked' their own dancing videos online, in reference to the video of the prime minister, which was leaked last week. 'SYMPATHY LEAK! In solidarity with Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin (whose party video has been leaked, so that certain types are now questioning what one can allow themselves to do as Prime Minister),' the post's caption read. 'We at ALT for the ladies' editorial office have emptied the camera roll of clips that should never have seen the light of day. 'And no, you don't become a worse prime minister, director, school teacher...put in a job yourself...by firing it up on the dance floor at the weekend,' it went on. Others have been posting messages of support with the hashtags #solidaritywithsanna and #istandwithsanna. One woman posted a video of herself dancing with the message 'Solidarity with Sanna. Happens to all of us. Very secret, stupid, drunk video of me and my friends!!!

They also went to two bars. The leaked video was taken from the Instagram stories of a private account and appears to show Finland's prime minister and her group of Finnish celebrity friends completely unguarded. Among the public figures seen in the video are Finnish singer Alma and her sister Anna, rapper Petri Nygard, TV host Tinni Wikstrom, photographer and influencer Janita Autio, radio host Karoliina Tuominen, as well as MPs from her own Social Democratic party.The fun-loving video has drawn criticism within Finland by those who consider the behaviour inappropriate for a world leader, especially in a time of national emergency, with Finland ending its historical neutrality to join NATO and grappling with a belligerent Russia.At one point a man swishes what appears to be an alcoholic drink past the camera as the beat drops and Marin and her friends dance wildly.A little earlier in the video, someone can be heard shouting that 'damn this is going to be a good feeling'.  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n   At one point a man swishes what appears to be an alcoholic drink past the camera as the beat drops and Marin and her friends dance wildly\n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n  The leaked video, which is sure to cause embarrassment, was taken from the Instagram stories of a private account and appears to show Finland's prime minister and her group of Finnish celebrity friends completely unguarded \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n   Marin pictured ready to party at the Flow festival in Helsinki with photographer and influencer Janita Autio - who was featured in the party video - on the latter's Instagram accountMarin was dubbed 'the coolest politician in the world' by German tabloid Bild for her relaxed and down-to-earth style of leadership which some critics have slammed as 'careless'. The paper described her as 'relaxed, modern and self-confident' but it added that she 'can also party'. Marin belongs to the 'cool generation' which Putin really doesn't like, Bild wrote. Despite the incoming flak for the young prime minister, there are also those who see the video as giving her a potential popularity boost for behaving the way many young people do.The embarrassing video comes just months after Marin was forced to apologise for going out clubbing till 4am after coming into contact with a Covid-19 case.She came under criticism for missing the text telling her she needed to isolate because she had left her work phone that, as prime minister, she should have had on her at all times at home.Back in December as Omicron rocked Europe, Marin was seen enjoying a Saturday night out at the Butchers nightclub with friends.  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Copy link to paste in your message\n        \n      \n      \n    \n   Sanna Marin became one of the youngest world leaders in 2019 when she became Finland's prime minister at the age of 34 However, hours earlier her Foreign Minister who had had been in close contact with tested positive for Covid. Initially Marin claimed that she did not need to isolate as she was fully vaccinated.But because she had left her prime minister's phone at home, she missed the instructions from her own government that she did need to stay home. She came under fierce criticism for this mishap, with people wondering what would have happened had there been an emergency. In a statement on Facebook, she said: 'I am very sorry for not understanding that I needed to do that.' She was spotted at the nightclub at midnight with her husband Markus Räikkönen and their friends, where she drank Heineken beer and danced.An eyewitness told the local newspaper: '[Marin] sat down with friends and it seemed fun. I noticed that Sanna was a little disturbed by people staring. At the end of the evening, the party surrounded the Prime Minister so that she could be more at ease.'Marin became one of the youngest world leaders and Finland's youngest ever when she assumed the role of prime minister at the age of 34 in 2019.She is part of an emerging trend of female leaders emanating from Scandinavia, which includes Katrin Jakobsdottir of Iceland, Magdalena Andersson of Sweden, Mette Frederiksen of Denmark and also Kaja Kallas of Estonia.The all-female leaders hail from countries in Scandinavia and the Baltics which are staring down Russian warmonger president Vladimir Putin at a time of intensely heightened international tension. Marin and her Estonian counterpart Kaja Kallas have called for an EU-wide visa ban on Russian citizens as part of the latest prong in the economic war being fought against Putin.Finland is already planning to slash the number of visas it issues to Russians, with the land border between the two countries being one of the few entry points into Europe for Russians after a string of Western countries closed their airspace to Russian planes. ",

        "content": "A journalist has revealed how he turned the tables on an online fraudster by pretending to play ball with him. Maynard Manyowa responded to a spam email promising him untold riches – and his detective work ended up being able to pass on details of a suspicious bank account to the authorities. Maynard, who writes for Yorkshire Live, said: “My Instagram bio ought to be a deterrent. Not only does it describe me a journalist, but, it also has a link to my verified Muckrack portfolio, full with articles from my days as a hard hitting investigative reporter in Africa. “But that did not scare away a Nigerian scammer who stormed into my private messages armed with a seemingly disarming profile – a young woman using the name Kimone Mattis Investments.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opening invitation sent to Maynard\n (Image: Yorkshire Live/MEN Media)\n\n  Maynard says the conversation was polite, with the con artist “asking me if I was interested in a venture that would help me make extra money for bills”. He added: “I knew what was coming, and for once decided I would play ball and play along. \"Nothing like wasting a scammer's time, and while at it doxxing a few of his money mules. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe details of what was apparently on offer in the scam\n (Image: Yorkshire Live/MEN Media)\n\n “My scammer offered to double my investments in 30 to 45 mins. I agreed and offered £800, which I wanted turned into £8,000 in half an hour.”Promoted Stories Maynard refused to send money via CashApp or World Remit, and said he would need details of a London bank account. “After some hesitancy, it came through. Just like that, and right there and then,” he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaynard kept the correspondence going, reeling in the fraudster\n (Image: Yorkshire Live/MEN Media)\n\n “An HSBC bank account registered to a ‘Chloe Paige Y’ [not the full name]. “For kicks, I sent the scammer £1, knowing well I wouldn’t get it back, but knowing it would piss him off but also show I was willing to play ball.” Maynard says he gave the scammer the runaround all evening and the next day, before starting to uncover the crook’s other money mules. “I claimed his bank was rejecting my payments, but offered £500 instead. I knew his eyes would light up. I sent him a link to confirm if my phone could send him money through other ways and he inadvertently showed me his IP address which was in Lagos, Nigeria. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually, the scammer began to reveal identities\n (Image: Yorkshire Live/MEN Media)\n\n For the latest breaking news stories and incredible tales from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking here. “I asked to use World Remit after that. The details came. One ‘Jerry Jojo R’. And with instructions to send the money to Jamaica instead. “When I asked for Jerry's Jamaican address, I spooked my scammer and he suggested CashApp instead. He played straight into my hands on that one. “On CashApp, he gave me another ID, one ‘Chaunta W’. “I now knew who my scammer was using to move his funds in the UK, in Jamaica, and now in the US.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails of a UK bank account were also revealed\n (Image: Yorkshire Live/MEN Media)\n\n Maynard approached HSBC, the bank that houses Chloe Paige Y's account. They promised to look into the account. A spokesperson for HSBC said: “HSBC UK takes scams and fraud seriously and is committed to preventing criminals from accessing the financial system. “We actively look for unusual activity and take appropriate and timely action when customer accounts are being used to facilitate financial crime.”   \n        \n         Powered by\n          \n    \n    \n        \n      Maynard also took his findings to the police, where he was redirected to Action Fraud. “As for my scammer, he is still holding out, waiting and hoping, and swearing on his late parents' lives,” says Maynard. “Nothing gives me greater joy than knowing not only did I waste his time, but I am terrorising him with hope, the same way he does to his victims.” ",
